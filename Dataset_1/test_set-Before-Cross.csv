56,california 1 17 01 pt ii one of the issues we have been following with respect to the california power crisis concerns the role of prospective broader federal involvement in the issue post inauguration in the last two days we have seen two signals suggesting that the bush administration will not significantly deviate from the broker role played by the clinton white house 1 in his confirmation hearing this morning treasury secretary designate o neill cautioned that it is not clear that us intervention is needed in california and that the governor must be the first line of defense 2 a source close to bush economic advisor larry lindsey reported to us yesterday that there was little that the federal government could do specifically to help beyond focusing on national issues increased production transmission capacity etc of course the bush treasury officials are likely to be more cautious with respect to intervention than the energy team as was true with the clinton administration yet lindsey in particular is unlikely to deviate far from the official bush view at this stage further guidance should be forthcoming with respect to this issue from energy secretary designate spence abraham s testimony tomorrow,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0

investment manager michael mansfield the biggest financial bubble in history in the article after the fall in the june 16 2005 issue of economist magazine real estate was called the biggest financial bubble in history what makes this real estate market so risky is that the crazy speculation in housing has spread around the world people continue to buy houses simply because prices are rising without any regard to fundamentals this is similar to what happened with the stock market during the 1990 s when investors bought shares of profitless companies just because everyone else was doing the same in fact many of thepeople who have gotten or are getting into real estate are the ones that got killed by the stock market during the 2000 crash consequently these will probably be the same

110,re pricing credit on thousands of names we can continue the discussion in tuesday s conference call but i discussed with ben about the issues below and here are some thoughts this is not a complete approach but only a starting point for discussion the main task is to build a pricing system for many names this has two components 1 how to price a single name 1 1 how to price a liquid single name 1 2 how to price an illiquid single name 2 how to efficiently apply the methodology to multiple names the approach i would take for 1 1 is a define a small set of liquid names b apply each of the different models we have say the six models ben has mentioned below to these names c include market prices if any for these names d sit with traders get trader s intuition on where each liquid name should price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in b and c e try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion of the trader prices across the models f quantify these attributes if possible g try a different set of liquid names and repeat the process and see if the decisions in the last round still make sense the approach for 1 2 may be a define a small set of illiquid names b apply each of the different models we have to these names c sit with traders get trader s intuition on where each illiquid name should price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in b d try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion of the trader prices across the models e check if these are similar to the attributes identified for liquid names f define a master set of liquid names g look for relationships by analyzing cross section of data between attributes or prices of illiquid names to those of liquid names once a mapping has been defined for an illiquid name to a set of liquid names and their attributes then this mapping can be entered into a table and the pricing can be automated for all names in theory the success will depend on the success of the round table sessions for the approaches for 1 1 and 1 2 building a new fundamental model is always a worthwhile task but we can get going with the above approaches immediately in parallel with developing any new models that we may build new models can be added to the suite of existing models i do not believe there will ever be a single model that will answer all questions for all names but rather we can refine the mappings and relative choices among models over time which would mean continuing round table sessions with traders limited data makes calibration very hard so i would continually ask the question what do we calibrate throughout the discussions for 1 1 and 1 2 and this may help guide us to new models vasant benjamin parsons 06 19 2000 04 11 am

david a wall risk mgmt lon ect ect jitendra j patel lon ect ect oliver gaylard lon ect ect subject pricing credit on thousands of names all our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to provide differential pricing on thousands of credits 5 000 by year end most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information making the challenge harder and the end result more important in terms of competitive pricing advantage what we need is an overall strategy for how we plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under development fmc model default probability approach using bloomberg s fair market par yield curves probabilities are generated from the risky libor then default bankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology fmc model credit spread approach using the fmcs then directly taking the libor credit spread at each tenor adjusting for basis and compounding differences bond model fmc approach taking the fmcs as benchmark curves the model regresses the input bonds specific to a name on the two best fitting benchmarks the result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the fmcs but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer prices are then generated using both spread and probability approaches under testing bond model spline approach taking only the bonds specific to an issuer the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zero coupon price curve then builds a zero yield curve from this under testing market prices for certain liquid names or sectors ratings cds market prices are used then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap prices kmv using expected default frequencies edfs from the kmv model and database we will build a model to price default swaps making appropriate risk adjustments kmv is being installed now so model will be worked on next each of these models returns a price credit default and bankruptcy and the accuracy of the price depends on many factors liquidity and regulatory differences between bond and cds markets recovery assumptions risk premia capital charges etc the aim will be to accurately price as many liquid names as possible based upon these models then use these prices alongside other financial information as the backbone to a full automated pricing system our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and market prices for all issuers alongside name specific soft data from credit reports and financial statements if the credit is liquid enough a price will be generated from their own information only otherwise the credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits with financial information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights the model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with market or trader prices and this adjustment will feed back into the weighting and mapping composition in loose terms we could think of the system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid market prices bonds equities default swaps where the weightings are calibrated using credit analysis financial ratios etc the key steps to implementing such a system will be establishing what exactly we want to predict is it a price a rating a probability or a score we will need a clean market history to calibrate to which we only really have for ratings we will then need to develop a mapping from rating score to price getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to calibrate the model building the mechanics of the model ie the calibration methodology neural nets fuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates but which exact methods and software packages to use determining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited information into the model getting the true market price in order to feed back an error at present such a price exists for very few credits allocating resources to the development mckinsey claimed such a system would take 6 10 man months to develop further ideas or comments are requested as we need to develop our strategy asap the model description above is fairly vague as we don t yet have the knowledge needed to fill in the specific details further help will be especially required on this if we are to continue to move at internet speed regards ben,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0

124,adaptive trade vince zimin i participated in a telephone conference on this company this morning there was a possibility enron would invest in it their product appears to be a gui interface over the top of ilog solver and possibly ilog cplex which allows problems to be expressed in high level terms i do not see any immediate application at enron but i am interested in the concepts used so expressed an interest in a demo maybe it would be useful for general modelling projects here they do not even have a user manual for their software so it will be difficult to figure out what it does unless a demo is arranged the possibility for growth in the company seems small as the ilog software is a modest size market and their product is aimed at only a small part of that market i think the scheduling tools in sap i 2 etc are more likely to succeed than this one as they are already integrated into an information system because of the small market for this software the many competitors the absence of any clear use for it at enron and the early stage of development there is very little prospect of us funding this company tom,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0

135,jcc good morning i apologize for the response delay i ve gone back through the analysis that i did back in april and have thrown around some ideas with vince and stinson the issue may be summarized as follows the hedge relationship was derived using jcc and prompt brent and is valid for jcc and prompt brent no problems here however it will not be valid for points far out on the forward curve intuitively this hedge relationship will approach one as we move far out on the curve but since there is no data i can not statistically determine this one can imagine a term structure of heding ratios that start at 0 67 and move to 1 0 so that the back end of the curves would move together but how fast it converges to one is anyone s guess if there is a way of determining the historical jcc forward curve then the hedge relationships may be estimated however i have been unable to determine a rigorous approach to building the jcc curve i can explain this far better in person and would like to talk as soon as possible at your convenience kevin kindall,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0

to firewalls but what of the open source hacker s dream of linux on every desktop 8 sure linux on the desktop has become more accessible than ever with colorful shrink wrapped boxes of caldera red hat and corel linux now available at places like compusa however analysts have said that linux s growth in the enterprise will be limited to the macro and micro areas of network servers and embedded operating systems according to idc linux currently runs on only 4 of u s desktops the hold microsoft windows has on the desktop market will remain strong analysts say despite such factors as microsoft s antitrust problems and the surging popularity of linux even some linux executives are skeptical of their product s desktop future recently suse ceo roland dyroff downplayed linux s future on desktops dyroff said given the lack of applications available we really can t claim it as being competitive on the desktop yet 8 a recent survey by survey com gives more hope for linux desktops according to the survey of 1 640 enterprise network managers open source operating systems are used on 10 of desktops with the number jumping to a surprising 23 of enterprise desktops by 2002 despite the mix of numbers being thrown around two important factors that will determine the success of linux as an enterprise client desktop are a standardized easy to use graphical user interface gui and available applications one company that is working to make linux more user friendly is palo alto based eazel which is designing a next generation file management system and user interface to run on top of the linux kernel according to eazel s web site the company s goal is to bring linux to the masses and do it in a way that appeals to today s linux users and to mere mortals 8 the company was founded by a group of former apple executives and is allied with the gnome project which has been doing extensive linux desktop environment development for several years eazel is due to have a product out by the middle of this year with an intuitive icon based file management environment eazel is hoping its user interface will be an improvement over the two current linux guis gnome and kde and will help standardized the look and feel of linux for regular 8 users for enterprise mangers who have already embraced linux on the server side this development will be worth keeping an eye on on the applications side several office productivity suites have been available for some time such as sun s staroffice suite and koffice for the kde desktop corel has also ported its office products such as wordperfect over to linux to complement its own distribution of the operating system while there have been recent rumors started by linux care vice president arthur tyde that microsoft is working on a port of ms office to linux microsoft officials deny this while linux may never supplant windows as the industry standard desktop there should be plenty of opportunity for linux pcs in enterprise nets

168,vince and vasant here is a brief summary of my meeting with chris germany capacity trader at the east desk related to gas transmission typically pipelines lease capacity billed on a monthly basis an example might be the pipeline between south texas and brooklyn where you might pay 12 00 per month per 10 000 decatherms of capacity 0 40 per day a fixed payment variable charges are 6 for fuel costs shrinkage and 6 5 for overhead expenses a gas trader might call south texas and be quoted a delivery price tomorrow of nymex 0 10 basis and might call brooklyn and be quoted a delivered price of nymex 0 25 the trader s spread is 0 35 and variable costs of transmission are 0 125 so the trader would offer the leaseholder of capacity up to 0 225 for firm capacity tomorrow as for the distinction betweem firm and interruptible the leaseholders have an excellent knowledge of the firm equivalent of interruptible capacity also many pipelines don t discount firm capacity from the tariff maximum it s not worth their time to haggle there is a further issue of secondary markets not important to the model yet for south texas and brooklyn there are several different routes the gas can physically take pipelines of enron texas eastern etc and once the trade is in the system traders can cover the enron positions on each end of the pipeline in so doing freeing up the capacity for other contracts clayton,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0

224,hurricane warning derivatives folks this note is intended to update all who may be concerned on our progress toward developing a commercial hurricane warning derivative product or line of products it is clear that numerous entities have underlying exposures to hurricane warning frequency and or duration it is our objective to develop derivative products that will enable these entities to effectively hedge this exposure we have generated a partial brainstorm style list of whom natural counterparties might be according to their underlying exposure pro hurricane anti hurricane the weather channel resorts home depot cruise ships lowes riverboat casinos cnn chemical plants and refineries local tv stations u s armed forces dry ice manufacturers athletic teams chainsaw manufacturers city governments insect repellant manufacturers state governments it is obvious that there are numerous naturally offsetting parties but it is important to note that the pro hurricane entities are more macro in nature while the anti hurricane entities are typically more regional thus we have documented the frequency and duration data by regional location with the thought that the anti hurricane entities would be interested in regional products and the pro hurricane entities would likely be more interested in bundled regional products depending on their exposure thus far we have collected and documented all u s hurricane warning data from 1980 2000 in the form of an excel database the data can be sorted by year storm or location on the u s coastline total hurricane warning duration as well as number of discrete hurricane warnings are the primary data sets of interest for any given location or year or storm the u s coast has been divided into 11 different geographic regions of roughly similar size these regions are new england mid atlantic virginia north carolina georgia south carolina east florida west florida florida panhandle orleans miss bama lousiana and texas while this data set may not yet be sufficient for price modeling purposes it has confirmed our expectation that hurricane warning frequency and duration is quite volatile and unpredictable it is believed that this volaility when graphically depicted and mathematically represented could be used to effectively demonstrate to would be customers the impact of hurricane warning frequency on their business financials in many cases businesses may be well aware of their exposure but may not have quantified it and certainly probably felt as if this was a risk they would have to wear themselves as we move forward on the modeling front the data will certainly need to be scrutinized to correct for any skewing factors such as political trends satellite availability population trends etc additionally we need to go further back in time so long as the accuracy doesn t decline on the marketing front i am certainly open to ideas it is believed the weather channel would be the most natural party for such a product given our positive relationship that we currently have with them they might be the easiest sell any and all ideas are welcome with regard to how and when we should approach customers please respond with any questions comments or concerns on this project thanks charlie,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0

227,urgent contact from the desk of dr tom eke e mail dr tomeke spinfinder com lagos nigeria attn request for urgent business relationship it is with my profound dignity that i write you this very important and highly confidential letter first i must solicit your strictest confidentiality in this transaction this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried considering the fact that we have not met each other before but i am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day we have decided to contact you by email due to the urgency of this transaction as we have been reliably informed that it will take at least a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal post to reach you so we decided it is best using the e mail which is quicker and also to enable us meet up with the second quater payment for the year 2000 however let me start by introducing myself properly to you i am dr tom eke a director general in the department of petroleum resources d p r and i presently head the contract award panel incharge of contract awards and payment approvals i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence i and my colleagues are top officials of the federal government contract award panel our duties include evaluation vetting approval for payment of contract jobs done for the d p r e t c in order to commence this business we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said funds the source of this funds is as follows in the second quarter of 2001 this committee was mandated to review and award contracts to the tune of us 400 million us dollars to a group of five firms for the supply construction and installation of oil pipe lines in warri and port harcourt during this process my colleagues and i decided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately over inflate the total contract sum from us 400 million to us 431 million united states dollars with the main intention of sharing the remaining sum of us 31 miilion amongst ourselves the federal government of nigeria has since the second quater of year 2001 approved the sum of us 431 million for us as the contract sum and the sum of us 400 million has also been paid to the foreign companies concerned as contract entitlements for the various contracts done but since the companies are entiltled to us 400 million dollars only we are now left with us 31 million dollars balance in the account which we intend to disburse amongst ourselves but by virtue of our positions as civil servants and members of this panel we cannot do this by ourselves as we are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau civil service laws from opening and or operating foreign accounts in our names while still in government service making it impossible for us to acquire the money in our names right now i have therefore been delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner into whose account we would transfer the sum of us 31 million hence we are writing you this letter my colleagues and i have agreed that if you or your company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our behalf you or your company will retain 20 of the total amount us 31 million while 70 will be for us officials and the remaining 10 will be used in offsetting all debts expenses and taxes incurred both local and foreign in the cause of this transfer needless to say the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous in return we demand your complete honesty and trust you must however note that this transaction will be strictly based on the following terms and conditions as we have stated below a our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence b that you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality c that you will not ask for more share or try to sit on the funds once it is under your custody or any form of blackmail d that upon receipt of the funds you will release the funds as instructed by us after you have removed your share of 20 from the total amount please note that this transaction is 100 legal and risk free and we hope to conclude this transaction seven to fourteen bank working days from the date of receipt of the necessary requirements from you we are looking forward to doing business with you and solicit your total confidentiality in this transaction there is no cause for alarm i give you my word that you are completely safe in doing business with us transactions like this have been successfully carried out in the past by most government executives here in my country there is great economic and political disarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant and the order of the day thus explaining why you might have heard stories of how money is been taken out of nigeria this is because everyone is making desperate attempts to secure his or her future so that when we retire from active service we donot languish in poverty i will explain more to you when i have heard from you please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using the above e mail address i will bring you into the complete picture of this pending business transaction when i have heard from you and also receive your confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me fax to you all necessary information you need to know about our pending business transaction i will also send to you my private telephone and fax numbers where you can always reach me your urgent response will be highly appreciated to enable us transfer the funds under the second quarter of the year 2002 thank you and god bless yours faithfully dr tom eke n b please be informed that this business transaction is 100 legal and completely free from drug money or money laundering this is a complete legitimate business transaction,1,1.0,1,0,1.0,1.0

274,preface for book vince hope you are well we spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book and you kindly offered that you would provide this is this still possible we realise that you are extremely busy so chris and les went ahead and wrote something which is below and if you want to review change or re write the preface that would be very appreciated let me know what your thoughts are thanks julie we re getting close preface one of our main objectives in writing energy derivatives pricing and risk management has been to bring together as many of the various approaches for the pricing and risk management energy derivatives as possible to discuss in depth the models and to show how they relate to each other in this way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models price a wide range of energy derivatives or to build a risk management system which uses a consistent modelling framework we believe that for practitioners this last point is very important and we continue to stress in our articles and presentations the dangers of having flawed risk management and giving arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using ad hoc and inconsistent models for different instruments and markets see also others who propose consistent models however it is not our wish to concentrate on one particular model or models at the exclusion of the others because we believe that the choice should rest with the user although it will probably be clear from our discussions the model s we prefer we therefore try and give as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of all the models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models which best suit their needs in order to meet our objectives the book is divided into 11 chapters in chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the book in addition to introducing the techniques that underlie the black scholes modelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing which are used throughout the book in chapter 2 we discuss the analysis of spot energy prices as well as analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes that can be used to model the prices we look at the well know process of geometric brownian motion as well as mean reversion stochastic volatility and jump processes discussing each and showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated chapter 3 written by vince kaminski grant masson and ronnie chahal of enron corp discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets this chapter builds on the previous one it examines in detail the methods merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different pricing models introduced in chapter 2 examples from crude gas and electricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative aspects of calculating volatility chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets although such curves are well understood and straight forward in the most financial markets the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined curves in this chapter we describe forward price bounds for energy prices and the building of forward curves from market instruments we outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building forward curves in energy markets the arbitrage approach the econometric approach and deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic factors chapter 5 presents an overview of structures found in the energy derivative markets and discusses their uses examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps caps floors and collars as well as energy swaptions compound options asian options barrier options lookback options and ladder options chapter 6 investigates single and multi factor models of the energy spot price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives closed form solutions for forward prices forward volatilities and european option prices both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate model chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 simulation schemes are developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a variety of path dependent options in order to price options which incorporate early exercise opportunities a trinomial tree scheme is developed this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard european and american style options chapter 8 describes a methodology for valuing energy options based on modelling the whole of the market observed forward curve the approach results in a multi factor model that is able to realistically capture the evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves the user defined volatility structures can be of an extremely general form closed form solutions are developed for pricing standard european options and efficient monte carlo schemes are presented for pricing exotic options the chapter closes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the problem of managing the risk through time we begin with delta hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging illustrating the techniques using both spot and forward curve models the general model presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi factor hedging of a portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed chapter 10 examines the key risk management concept of value at risk var applied to portfolios containing energy derivative products after discussing the concept of the measure we look at how the key inputs volatilities covariances correlations etc can be estimated we then compare the fours major methodologies for computing var delta delta gamma historical simulation and monte carlo simulation applying each to the same portfolio of energy options in this chapter we also look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market variables finally in chapter 11 we review modelling approaches to credit risk we look in detail at two quite different approaches creditmetrics j p morgan 1997 and creditrisk credit suisse financial products 1997 for which detailed information is publicly available together these provide an extensive set of tools with which to measure credit risk we present numerical examples of applying these techniques to energy derivatives before we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this book are tools which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of how both the tool and the market works the techniques we describe are certainly not magic wands 8 which can be waved at data and risk management problems to provide instant and perfect solutions to quote from the riskmetrics technical document no amount of sophisticated analytics will replace experience and professional judgement in managing risk 8 however the right tools correctly used make the job a lot easier,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0

349,non firm power curve building hi vince amitava and i have received a request to build a non firm power curve for each region from david hoog s double trigger folks the objective as they explain it is to allow the desk to buy non firm from the market buy david s outage product and sell firm to the market accountants would like a curve to mark the non firm position my initial thought is that the desk should provide this non firm curve but it seems that this market is very illiquid and they are reluctant so they have put the ball in david hoog s court to build the curve if david wants to sell his product internally to the desk assuming we build the curve the next issue is how to define non firm the only way i can think of is to tie the non firmness to a specific generation unit or group of units this will allow the purchase of david s outage product to cover the non firmness risk tying the definition of non firmness to a whole region seems implausible what does it mean to give a marketer the option to not deliver power if there is any problem anywhere in the region consequently the non firm curve takes on a unit level interpretation and not a region level interpretation consequently i do not see how we can talk about the non firm curve for the region we will need to build a non firm curve for each generation unit or group of units maybe i could get your thoughts later today thanks vasant,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0

365,california update 5 4 01 if you have any questions please contact kristin walsh at 713 853 9510 bridge loan financing bills may not meet their may 8 th deadline due to lack of support sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance bridge loan by the may 8 th deadline any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart according to sources both the republicans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis the democratic caucus is reportedly unwilling to fight for davis many legislative republicans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that once the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund davis would double dip into the fund clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor however it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated a bond issuance will take place additionally some generator sources have reported that some of the long term power contracts as opposed to those still in development require that the bond issuance happen by july 1 2001 if not the state may be in breach of contract sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may 8 th having a bond issuance by july lst will be very difficult the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would eat the 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately 8 billion however the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor s plan for handling the crisis including the details and terms of all long term contracts he has negotiated before they will support the bond issuance to go forward currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan ab 8 x and ab 31 x ab 8 x authorizes the dwr to sell up to 10 billion in bonds this bill passed the senate in march but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support ab 31 x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts however sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen currently in ab 8 x senator bowen s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments which if passed would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund for instance tony strickland has stated that only 1 2 of the bonds or approximately 5 billion should be issued other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday additionally lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan key points of the bridge financing initial loan amount 4 125 b lenders jp morgan 2 5 b lehman brothers 1 0 b bear stearns 625 m tax exempt portion of the 4 125 b 1 6 b is expected to be tax exempt projected interest rate taxable rate 5 77 tax exempt rate 4 77 current projected blended ir 5 38 maturity date august 29 2001 for more details please contact me at 713 853 9510 bill sb 6 x passed the senate yesterday but little can be done at this time the senate passed sb 6 x yesterday which authorizes 5 billion to create the california consumer power and conservation authority the 5 billion authorized under sb 6 x is not the same as the 5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward again the republicans are not in support of these authorizations without the details of the long term power contracts the governor has negotiated the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb 6 x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power also there is no staff defined purpose etc for the california public power and conservation authority however this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis socal edison and bankruptcy at this point two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august 15 th however some decision will likely be made earlier according to sources the state has yet to sign the mou with socal though socal has signed it the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy or its creditor involuntary due to the lack operating cash the second likely triggering event which is linked directly to the bond issuance would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31 x bridge loan stating that the dwr would received 100 of its payments from ratepayers then the utilities would receive the residual amount in other words the state will get paid before the utilities if this language is included and passed by the legislature it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0

384,marketpoint license agreement john vince i really enjoyed the meeting the other day with you and a broad cross section of your people thank you very much for setting it up and thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak with your people as i mentioned to john i am sending you the license paperwork for marketpoint i have attached our standard license agreement for your consideration as i mentioned the license agreement covers the entire bundled product which includes north american gas short and long term north american electricity short and long term world gas western european gas world oil we are just finishing porting the world oil world gas and western european gas models over from our old now obsolete software system into marketpoint so they will not be fully tested and complete for a couple of months however the gas and electricity models for north america are presently complete and tested that should allow us to give you an attractive price before the full worldwide toolkit is available throughout your worldwide business as i understood it you will want the gas modeling capability first and will want to defer decisions on electric or other capability as i mentioned at the meeting we are prepared to offer that for approximately the fully bundled price as you read the license agreement you will see that the software licenses for 100 000 annually the gas data for 5 000 and the electric data for 10 000 marketpoint will agree to license you the gas model plus the data for the software license plus the data license for a total of 55 000 annually this is just under the fully bundled price i think that is consistent with the discussions at our meeting and from marketpoint s perspective would provide a great basis to move forward together with enron if or when enron ever desires to scale up 8 to another model or model s from the marketpoint portfolio we will simply scale you up to the entire license agreement this will allow you to decouple the gas decision from any other decisions you might make i will be glad to put this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move forward i felt i was able to communicate the philosophy scope and operation of our approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you might need to evaluate whether marketpoint meets your needs i thought you were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the same time its simplicity and effectiveness i thought you were able to see the benefits of the marketpoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use i would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues i look forward to your response and to moving ahead together we view you as a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to earn and secure your business if you decide to license marketpoint we can arrange to transfer and mount marketpoint and the short term narg model which is the model we suggest you begin with and travel to houston to deliver our 1 day training seminar our clients are usually very fluent after that 1 day training seminar thereafter we would want you to work with the short term narg model for a few weeks while you get up to speed very fluent and very comfortable before you take delivery of the longer term version of narg several weeks later thanks again and all the best if there is some item from the meeting that i might have forgotten to send please remind me my notes don t show anything but i was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted dale nesbitt president marketpoint inc 27121 adonna ct los altos hills ca 94022 650 218 3069 dale nesbitt marketpointinc com license doc,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0

426,cera monthly oil briefing cera alert december 20 2000 title cera monthly oil briefing fundamentals update e mail category cera monthly briefing cera knowledge area world oil in the past two weeks oil prices have sold off the premium or price strength that had been built into the market in anticipation of possible shortages this winter the exact cause of the sharp switch in market psychology is hard to pinpoint but seems to be a combination of very early signs that the oil stock situation is at least stabilizing even if stocks have not built substantially and that thus far despite a few weeks of colder than normal temperatures heating oil supply has been adequate to meet demand in the key us market that has allayed some of the concerns that were driving speculative interest into the market furthermore the potential for weakness in the us economy may be creating expectations for weaker oil demand in 2001 the change in market psychology was dramatically illustrated when news that iraq was cutting off exports caused prices to slide yet the iraqi export cutoff is having a concrete effect on fundamentals if the cutoff lasts through december the effect will be pronounced it would turn a projected fourth quarter 2000 stockbuild of 0 5 million barrels per day mbd into a stockdraw of 0 1 mbd we expect iraqi production levels to remain erratic because of its dispute with the un security council over sanctions and exports may again cease at some point such a development would have a price supportive effect cera s price outlook for 2001 remains the same as that in the world oil watch released in late november assuming normal winter weather and no prolonged or repeated shutdowns of iraqi production the projected average for first quarter 2001 is 29 per barrel for wti however this outlook is based on opec s announcing an agreement early in the first quarter to cut its production by the start of the second quarter a failure to restrain output would result in a downward adjustment to an average of 27 wti for the first quarter of 2001 with prices lower in the second half of the quarter than in the first the downward pressure results from the prospect of a larger than usual implied build in stocks during the second quarter of about 3 0 mbd with a cut in opec output iraq in a twilight zone as anticipated iraq ceased exporting oil under the un controlled oil for food program as of december 1 in protest over the rejection by the security council s sanctions committee of its proposed december export price schedule iraq s pricing was judged by the un overseers who monitor the export program and advise the sanctions committee to be about 60 cents per barrel below comparable crudes in an apparent attempt to offset an illicit surcharge that iraq was seeking from buyers although the standoff with the sanctions committee continues iraq partially resumed exporting on december 13 since then about 1 mbd has been exported from the mina al bakr terminal in the persian gulf prior to the shutdown iraqi exports under un auspices were at a rate of 2 21 mbd for november as compared with 2 08 mbd for the third quarter exports for november were about 1 3 mbd from mina al bakr and about 0 9 mbd from ceyhan in the mediterranean exports from ceyhan have not resumed owing to the surcharge dispute with the result that about 1 2 mbd of iraqi crude remains off the market iraq s semi shutdown has put it into a kind of twilight zone while its dispute with the sanctions committee over pricing continues in the midst of this dispute the un security council approved phase nine of the oil for food program at the last minute on december 5 it became effective on december 6 and has been accepted by iraq as of decemberl 9 iraq s revised export price for ceyhan proposed for the remainder of december has again been judged too low by the overseers and is expected to be rejected by the sanctions committee additionally the overseers have notified lifters of iraqi crude that any oil payment made directly to iraq rather than to the un escrow account would be a violation of un sanctions buyers of iraqi oil from mina al bakr have consistently been reported as saying that they are not paying a surcharge to iraq how long iraq may operate at about half capacity is unclear but it continues to request a surcharge payment from prospective lifters at ceyhan in an apparent effort to circumvent and degrade the un financial controls that are the heart of the sanctions system the distinction that iraq has made between mina al bakr and ceyhan arose when it resumed operations at mina al bakr by loading two cargoes for the india oil company iraq may have judged this accommodation to be in its interest since it recently also signed an oil exploration contract with india under which payments would be made in oil as currently structured the deal would violate un sanctions but india is seeking an exception from the security council on grounds of economic hardship the exception seems unlikely to be granted which may lead iraq to cease exports from mina al bakr again there are many possible scenarios that iraq could follow but we expect uncertainty about iraqi exports to continue as iraq uses its oil exports as leverage to undermine sanctions in its ongoing struggle with the security council to end all restraints consequently the iraq factor will remain an element in the oil price outlook iraq s antisanctions campaign has also raised the visibility of the iraq issue in washington as the incoming bush administration prepares to take office secretary of state designate colin powell has already acknowledged a need to reassess iraq policy and has said that he would work to reenergize sanctions the iraq issue is being debated in virtually every foreign policy oriented think tank in washington a consensus seems to be emerging around seeking renewed international support and legitimacy for sanctions by retaining un control over iraq s oil revenue and strictly enforcing a prohibition on sales of weapons and related material while lifting general trade controls that increasingly are both ineffective and an international irritant there is virtually no sentiment in favor of operations to destabilize or remove the saddam hussein regime on the pragmatic basis that the prospects for success are remote demand trends record high us natural gas prices have increased the economic incentive for gas consumers with the capability to switch from gas to distillate to do so and reports of switching are emerging in a number of areas interruptible gas customers with resid or distillate fuel back up have already switched to oil so it is now firm gas supply customers with the potential to add to the already high level of distillate demand so far in december us distillate demand is running at a record high december level of 3 9 mbd however only a small portion of this demand is the result of economically based fuel switching from gas to distillate cera estimates that the additional demand likely to come from further switching of gas to distillate is relatively small on the order of 0 1 to 0 2 mbd in cera s view it is likely that only a portion of the theoretical capacity will be switched on short notice because in some cases this theoretically switchable capacity has not been used in recent years and tankage and delivery infrastructure may be in uncertain condition switching by interruptible gas customers such as utilities to distillate began about a month or more ago although the volumes involved are relatively small switching to residual fuel already occurred months ago when gas prices started to surge in the summer a portion of the us secondary and tertiary distillate stockbuild seen this autumn was likely prompted by interruptible gas customers filling their reserve distillate fuel storage given the expectations of a tight gas market regulators have been explicit about enforcing back up fuel storage requirements in the months leading up to the current heating season other end users of natural gas have few or no options for fuel switching some ammonia and ethane producers have shut down operations because the cost of feedstock natural gas is high natural gas is also used in some enhanced oil recovery operations and some of these producers have also opted to sell gas back to the grid rather than produce oil supply trends non opec supply for the fourth quarter is expected to be up 0 9 mbd over a year earlier at 46 4 mbd recent events include a shortfall in mexican production curtailed in october by about 300 000 bd owing to the effects of hurricane keith mexico s fourth quarter liquids production is expected to be 3 64 mbd about 95 percent of mexican liquids capacity norway s output increased 200 000 bd from october to november as maintenance season ended norway s production for the fourth quarter is expected to be 3 53 mbd growing russian crude oil production throughout the year is supporting a recent surge in exports in spite of higher export taxes russian exports of domestic oil production excluding transit volumes reached 2 5 mbd in november after remaining fairly steady at about 2 35 mbd from july though october fourth quarter oil exports are expected to average 2 5 mbd 0 3 mbd greater than in the fourth quarter 1999 cera estimates iraqi oil production averaged 2 91 mbd in november down 0 1 mbd from the october level the cutoff in exports earlier this month reduced iraqi output for the first 12 days of december to roughly 0 8 mbd iraq resumed exports of about 1 mbd on december 13 which raised production to 1 80 mbd assuming no change in iraq s current production stance iraqi production would average 1 41 mbd for december on a quarterly basis the decline in iraq output would lead to estimated opec output in the fourth quarter of 29 0 mbd and would turn an estimated global oil stockbuild of 0 5 mbd into a stockdraw of 0 1 mbd these production estimates include 0 15 mbd of crude oil exports to syria that began on november 20 without un authorization and are continuing oil stocks us crude oil inventories doe data have climbed intermittently from an annual low of 280 million barrels in september and reached 292 million barrels in mid december see figure 1 since prices weakened in late november crude oil stocks have stabilized above the annual low in september and the ranges seen in october to levels from 289 292 million barrels primary inventories of us heating oil remain well below year earlier levels at 48 million barrels they are 15 million barrels or 24 percent less than those of a year ago but there are indications of builds in secondary and tertiary inventories we estimate that wholesale and consumer stocks are up 5 10 million barrels since august and are actually higher than they were at the end of last year in europe crude oil stocks are at more comfortable levels when compared with those of the united states in november stocks rose nearly 9 million barrels to 426 million barrels at this level they are below the highs of 1999 but well above the low levels of early 1996 see figure 2 japanese crude oil inventories at end october were 107 6 million barrels which is above the record low set earlier this year but still well below levels seen in recent years see

474,california 1 17 01 summary late night efforts by the california assembly to craft a legislative solution are falling short of market and creditor expectations bankruptcy appears increasingly likely but the dynamics of a ch 11 proceeding remain unclear socal edison is likely to be the first in ch 11 following its suspended payments to creditors yesterday and is now in a 30 day cure period attempts to bring in the assets of the parent companies are unlikely to succeed bankruptcy would provide davis with some political cover to implement the tough decisions that he has so far avoided on the questions of rate hikes and other costs to taxpayers connected to the proposed operations of the california power authority 1 legislation passes assembly but generators and consumers remain unhappy the first legislation ab lx passed the california general assembly last night but both generators and consumers are unhappy with the terms generators object to the 5 5 cent per kw h price in the proposed long term contract while consumer groups such as the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights object to the state acting as a purchaser of power the legislation is expected to pass the senate today and to be signed by governor davis as early as tonight press and source reporting this morning confirms that the principal financial creditors and utility analysts are also unimpressed with the bill which is viewed as insubstantial and falling short of creating a solution to the financial pressures on the utilities 2 financial institutions exposure to california utilities bank of america 215 million j p morgan 202 million there is a total of 12 billion in outstanding loans but much of this arranged by societe general is to the parents national energy group and edison international the 417 million mentioned above is the most immediate concern the southern california edison loans are subject to immediate repayment in the aftermath of yesterday s rating downgrade to junk status the fed will not be involved except in a routine way as a bank regulator making sure that the appropriate risk reserves are made against the utilities loans and securities there is no moral hazard here because the fed is not going to guarantee any of the utilities credits which by the way they do not have the authority to do 3 pg e national energy group shielding assets despite considerable anger at pg e for reorganizing to shield its profitable assets from its debt plagued utility business it would seem that davis has little authority to intervene the question of fraudulent conveyance which is a term in bankruptcy law for transferring assets to favored parties not long before a filing which transfer can then be reversed by the court would not seem to apply here since pg dynegy has threaten to take take edison into bankruptcy court if they default pg e current available 500 m in cash and reserves due feb lst 580 m to iso 15 th 431 m to california power exchange contrary to press reports and leaks from the governor s office yesterday about political brinksmanship edison is clearly not playing negotiating games and is really short of cash in this situation it is unlikely that its executives will be making fraudulent statements the bonds on which they failed to pay would have a 30 day cure period after that the trustees will move on edison if edison has not already filed they have three ways of financing power purchases going forward 1 the state continues to buy power and sell edison and pg or 2 pending the passage of today s legislation the state legislature authorizes the purchase of power through long term contracts under the proposed borrowing authority or 3 edison files for reorganization under chapter 11 and obtains almost immediately superpriority post petition lines of credit secured against its unmortgaged assets which it uses to pay for power until the puc and the rest of the state government recognize that rates have to increase 6 new hampshire experience a guide for davis following the bankruptcy of the public service company of new hampshire the bankruptcy judge was authorized by a higher court to mandate rate hikes the prospect of imposed rate hikes from the bankruptcy court caused the state government to subsequently determine that rate hikes to consumers were unavoidable passing a seven year rate hike of 7 5 percent for davis a similar scenario would provide him with some political cover if he were forced by the bankruptcy court to pass through rate hikes as part of a settlement,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0

521,wall street s dirty little secret it was the spring of 1979 i was just a tall goofy looking kid in middle school with buck teeth and freckles each day in the cafeteria i walked from table to table stealing other kids lunch money no i didn t rob them with a gun or a knife i just made them a little deal let me borrow two dollars today i said and i ll bring you five dollars next week the investment was too good to pass up and other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes of course when next week rolled around and i couldn t pony up the cash i promised to pay them even more the week after that if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer eventually the end of the year came and went high school started and with it came girls and homework and parties and sports and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last year s lunch money i made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid and i didn t even get beat up hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn first of all greed is your number one enemy you re not going to turn 2 into 5 in a week so cash out when you re ahead don t wait for the boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket second never trust an investment adviser of any kind they are looking out for their own money not yours the professionals those stuffy investment counselors and money managers will always tell you that the best time to buy is now according to those guys the longer you keep your money in the market the more money you re going to make ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is never in a sense they are right if you put 250 000 in an index fund right now you ll probably have over a million dollars in thirty or forty years but here s the problem do you want to wait thirty or forty years to be rich hell no you want the money now so you can enjoy it it s hard to make use of your fortune when you re seventy years old in a wheelchair if you could make a million dollars in the next few years what would you do with it where would you travel what kind of car would you buy the fact is youth is the best time to be rich if your goal is to make quick profits in the market volatility is your ally and stability your enemy you want to see those large upswings two hundred points in a day followed by the four hundred point crash a week later you don t care if the market went up or down 20 this year as long it was unstable that s how you re going to make the money what i m talking about here is day trading my father invests the traditional way he holds some good stocks and he goes up 30 k and down 30 k in the long term of 5 10 years he makes money the day trader buys or sells 5 000 shares of xyz for a 25 000 profit in a 5 10 minute trade he acts quickly taking advantage of all the information at his disposal about a certain stock and estimating whether it will go up or down within hours sometimes within minutes i can teach you how to do this and how to make amazing amounts of money at it it s not rocket science and you only need to learn a few basic principles to get started society would have you believe that successful trading is complicated and requires formal training the truth is wealthy people use very simple investment strategies to make money popular media and investment professionals portray successful trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing ring they don t want the competetion and they sure as hell don t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm to execute a trade for which they d charge you forty or fifty dollars they make their money only if you believe two lies 1 that investing is too difficult and risky for the average person 2 that using an investment adviser who charges a high commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks per trade here is what the financial gurus in today s society absolutely positively do not want you to know the strategies for profitable day trading are in fact so simple that anyone can do it provided they spend a few hours of studying after reading over 200

546,full circle asps the new big blue network world fusion focus mike jude and nancy meachim on application service providers today s focus full circle asps the new big blue 03 15 00 dear wincenty kaminski today s focus full circle asps the new big blue by mike jude and nancy meachim the terms asp 8 and ibm 8 may have more in common than being three letter acronyms remember big blue of the early 60 s the vision then was centralized computing mainframe computers hosted complex expensive applications that end users accessed via dumb terminals it infrastructure especially memory was expensive and needed to be controlled with computing resources centralized ibm reasoned they were easier to maintain of course ibm got it wrong in that computers became a cheap commodity and users weren t happy simply using dumb terminals they wanted a bigger share in all that technology offered so as memory prices fell so did the idea of central control dumb terminals were transformed into intelligent desktop machines that could store applications and data the glass house populated by white smocked technicians went out of fashion looking back on those times many of us would shake our heads and wonder how ibm could have been so wrong but maybe big blue wasn t so far off thanks to the advent of application service providers centralized computing is making a comeback asps offer centralized application management the market started as a way to offer the benefits of server advertisement protocol and other complex enterprise resource planning software to small companies or companies with less technical savvy but asps now host all kinds of applications including small multilicensed programs whose images are downloaded to end users on demand but the principle remains the same central control makes support much more efficient and usually cheaper how about that ibm to be fair the dynamics of an asp are very different from old centralized mainframe operations an asp doesn t just host and support an application for general distribution over an in house proprietary network unlike the ibm vision an asp is very dependent on network service it is also very sensitive to service levels in the 60 s if the mainframe let you down you ended up twiddling your thumbs for an hour or so and your only recourse was that white smocked fellow nowadays users start to scream if service is interrupted for even a minute and woe to the asp who brings down a customer operation the world of the asp is much more complex than that of the old 60 s shop however if one could magically transport a computer user from the 60 s to the wonderful new 2000 s would it seem all that different to him in an ideal asp world a la scott mcnealy s vision users would sit down at a semidumb terminal download the application du jour and start working what did the 60 s user do kind of the same thing so you are probably wondering what is the point just this ibm s problem was leaving the customer out of the equation and look what happened customers rebelled they didn t buy ibm s spiel it became the in 8 thing to hate ibm why because the guys in white smocks couldn t spell service and didn t care about customers to be successful asps need to learn from the past they need to tattoo service on the forehead of each of their employees there are too many choices today for customers to put up with inferior service that s one big difference from the 60 s customers now can literally choose any service provider in the world just being big doesn t cut it these days to contact mike jude

561,california update 4 27 01 the following report contains confidential and sensitive information please treat with discretion executive summary ferc price cap decision reflects bush political and economic objectives politically bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on davis from an economic perspective he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation davis finds four major flaws with ferc plan most notably its exclusion of out of state generators june lst kill clause for ferc order could coincide with new bush regional plan california facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade expected 20 billion power bill this summer economic crisis would force deeper administration involvement qf bid for advance payments from pg e likely to fail in bankruptcy court new generation delays probable because of state qf squabbling consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to socal bailout deal 1 ferc fallout the ferc decision is a holding move by the bush administration that looks like action but is not rather it allows the situation in california to continue to develop virtually unabated the political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where davis cannot escape shouldering the blame once they are politically inoculated the administration can begin to look at regional solutions moreover the administration has already made explicit and will certainly restate in the forthcoming cheney commission report its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation it is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the ferc order and that the only ferc commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan 2 something less than effective price caps from davis s point of view the ferc plan has four major flaws the order applies only to california not to the rest of the west non california generators are not required to sell at capped rates to california as the order is written it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling state officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a stage 2 emergency and does not require any collusion even when the price caps kick in they are based on the cost plus for the highest cost producer supplying power to california and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap the generators can also charge above the cap provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to ferc 3 proposal kill clause adds to the political dilemma for davis the ferc proposal includes a kill clause that says the caps will be withdrawn unless california s iso agrees by june lst to become part of the regional grid now under ferc control if davis doesn t sign on to the regional grid by june lst then he will have to live with june 2 nd headlines blaming him for letting the bush price caps plan collapse 4 growing fiscal risk in california sources speculate that california could therefore pay as much as 20 billion on power this summer this is more than the combined enterprise value of pg e and sce these sources believe that because of the severity of the situation the ferc and or the federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for power the consensus is that the state of california will run out of money in about 90 days one of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for long term power deals the bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to california the bush administration and the fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture the country s largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months 5 qfs to seek advance payment from pg e meanwhile on the bankruptcy front the qfs reportedly will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from pge s accounts since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for gas it appears very unlikely that the qfs request will be granted if the qfs do not receive advance payment it is likely that most of the 4 000 mw of gas fired qf capacity will remain offline 6 delays likely in new qf generation the qf deals made with the state for long term contracts are being continually renegotiated which is likely to mean that the new plants those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated 7 consumer groups ready to challenge constitutionality of sce bailout plan harvey rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis of the mou for the sce bailout plan the analysis was done by a utilities analyst rather than a lawyer though it appears to raise a number of good legal points for example one of the elements of the mou is a non bypassable charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid this is effectively a tax since there is no exchange of value for money which under the ca constitution cannot be used to directly benefit a private entity this makes the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds rather than revenue bonds according to the constitution the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private company for this and other reasons even if the republicans would vote for the sce bailout which remains unlikely the bailout probably would not stand a likely constitutional challenge 8 governor hurt by continued failure to disclose long term power contracts the issue of the governor s failure to disclose the details of the long term power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged creating an even further delay,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0

momentum continues sales projections for next 12 months surpasses 20 million 99 8 revenue increase 278 net income increase 154 stockholders equity increase 79 increase in assets 8 million order backlog 50 million manufacturing capacity overview global diversified industries operates in the modular building construction industry and strategically targets the california education sector gdvi is strategically located in central california on 16 acres with a 100 000 square foot state of the art manufacturing facility throughout 2003 and 2004 the company focused on building its infrastructure through acquisitions development of a state of the art manufacturing facility and by securing the requisite financing facilities to fuel business growth through the combination of its new facility 50 million capacity the increased demand for portable buildings and the state of california s bond approvals gdvi has become well positioned to become one of the dominant leaders in modular manufacturing on the west coast gdvi should benefit greatly from the 12 1 billion school improvement bond that is expected to be passed by california voters next month march this presents in our opinion an opportunity for early investors of gdvi to also benefit before the mainstream investor realizes who the benefactors are and subsequently invests in those companies global diversified has taken numerous strategic development steps throughout 2003 and 2004 including generating strong revenues as well as profits and is now poised for explosive growth in 2005 the company is led by a strong management team with previous success in building companies into 50 million per annum businesses in the past year gdvi has exceeded its own sales revenue projections renewed its piggyback contract received state approvals on engineered product designs started a new credit facility and opened its new 100 000 square foot manufacturing facility the company will continue to seek new acquisition candidates through its aggressive growth plan profile gdvi is a holding company that currently operates two wholly owned subsidiaries mbs construction inc a modular contractor specializing in modular construction site work and renovation and global modular inc a sales marketing and manufacturing of modular type structures its principal customer base is currently educational public and private schools universities etc child care and municipality sectors its product lines consist of a variety of portable classroom designs including both single story and two story floor plans global modular s portable classroom structures are engineered and constructed in accordance with pre approved building plans commonly referred to as p c s or pre checked plans that conform to structural and seismic safety specifications administered by the california department of state architects dsa global modular also enjoys the benefit of providing educational customers with products contracted under a piggyback clause the state of california allows school districts to canvass proposals from modular classroom vendors under a bidding process where the successful bidder can provide other public school districts and municipalities portable classrooms under a piggyback contract issued by the originating school district this process saves school districts valuable time and resources from the necessity of soliciting bids a modular vendor who possesses a piggyback contract containing competitive pricing and a variety of design options may have access to future business for up to five years depending on the term of the piggyback contract the strategic focus on california schools since 1998 california legislation has required that at least 20 of all new classrooms constructed with state funds be portable structures there are five compelling reasons for this trend modular classrooms are faster to construct as quickly as 2 weeks they cost significantly less as low as 30 000 vs 100 000 they offer greater flexibility for use compared to conventional buildings they are easier to finance they provide financing incentives to cope with population growth the state department of education estimates that california will need more than 2 500 classrooms each year for the next four years which equates to more than 10 000 classrooms due to the current and projected budget cuts throughout the california education sector public and private schools are expected to turn to portable modular construction to fulfill their additional classroom requirements over the next four years the california schools budget crisis on november 5 2002 a 13 2 billion school facilities improvements bond proposal proposition 47 was passed by california voters this bond measure passage does not include an approximate 9 4 billion worth of local bond measures passed by various school districts throughout the state a second bond measure worth 12 1 billion went before the voters on the march 2004 these bond measures are about three times higher than the record 9 2 billion bond california voters approved in 1998 the revenue generated from these bond measures will be used for school modernization programs which include requirements for relocatable classrooms and modular classroom construction and renovations money from the bonds will help overcrowded public and private schools design upgrades and expand building space at community colleges and other institutions of higher learning throughout california gdvi business infrastructure among global modular s asset base is its

578,re energy derivatives hi vince hope all is well with you i m looking forward to seeing you again next week and meeting with grant can you guys do me favour i m sending out some sample chapters to the people who responded positively all of them to my request for some feedback on the book chapter 1 has an overview of the book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter could you please write a sentence or two for your chapter i m including what i have already written so that you can see the style many thanks and best regards chris 2 overview of this book this book aims to provide an in depth understanding of the pricing and risk management of energy derivatives in the remainder of this chapter we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy assets and which underlie the rest of the book as well as introducing the techniques that underlie the black scholes modelling framework we discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the book in chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices apart from describing empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model the prices we look at the well know process of gbm as well as mean reversion stochastic volatility and jump processes discussing each and showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated chapter 3 written by vince kaminski and grant masson of enron capital and trade chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets although such curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined curves what we do in this chapter chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not so common derivative structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps caps floors and collars as well as energy swaptions compound options asian or average rate options barriers lookbacks and ladder options chapter 6 investigates single and multi factor models of the energy spot price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives closed form solutions for forward prices forward volatilities and european option prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate model with jumps chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 simulation schemes are developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a variety of path dependent options in order to price options which incorporate early exercise opportunities a trinomial tree scheme is developed this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard american style options chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on modelling the market observed forward curve the approach results in a multi factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility structures can be of an extremely general form closed form solutions are developed for pricing standard european options and efficient monte carlo schemes for exotic options the chapter finishes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced with the problem of managing the risk through time we begin with delta hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging using the models from chapters 5 and 7 the general model of chapter 7 ideally suited to multi factor hedging and this is also discussed chapter 10 looks at the key risk management concept of value at risk applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios after discussing the concept of the measure we look at how the key inputs volatilities covariances correlations etc can be estimated we then compare the fours major methodologies for computing var delta delta gamma historical simulation and monte carlo simulation finally we look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market variables finally we finish with credit risk in energy markets in chapter 11,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0

589,info you requested kcc thank you for your interest judgment coursesoffers an extensive training course in how to collect moneyjudgments if you are like many people you are not even sure what a money judgment is and why processing money judgments can earn you very substantial income if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you will have a money judgment against them you are happy you won but you will soon find out the shocking fact its now up to you to collect on the judgment the court does not require the loser to pay you the court will not even help you you must trace the loser down find their assets their employment bank accounts real estate stocks and bonds etc very few people know how to find these assets or what to do when they are found the result is that millions of judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten in 79 of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a dime the non payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic proportions right now in the united states there is between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedmoney judgment debt for every judgment that is paid 5 more judgments take its place we identified this massive market 8 years ago and have actively pursued judicial judgments since we invented this business we have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed with our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing money judgments by following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of money judgments the income potential is substantial in this profession we have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making 96 000 00 to over 200 000 00 per year part time associates are earning between 24 000 00 and 100 000 00 per year some choose to operateout of their home and work by themselves others build a sizable organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business offices today our company and our associates have over 126 million dollars in money judgments that we are currently processing of this 126 million 25 million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates joint ventures are where we make our money we only break even when our course is purchased we make a 12 margin on the reports we supply to our associates our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies police officers attorneys credit agencies etc all come to us for reports many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off the norm is 10 interest compounded annually on unpaid money judgments annual interest on 5 million at 10 translates to 500 000 00 annually in interest income not counting the payment of the principal our associates earn half of this amount or 250 000 00 per year this is just for interest not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income typically companies are sold for 10 times earnings just based on simple interest an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately 2 5 million dollars 92 of all of our associates work out of their home 43 are women and 36 are part time one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame if you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go the judgments you are working on will be there when you return the judgments are still in force they do not disappear the way we train you is non confrontational you use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing you never confront the debtor the debtor doesn t know who you are you are not a collection agency simply stated the steps to successful money processing are as follows mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with money judgments we train you how to find out who to write to 8 to 11 of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help they call you you don t call them unless you want to you send them an agreement supplied in the course to sign which splits every dollar you collect 50 to you and 50 to them this applies no matter if the judgment is for 2 000 00 or 2 000 000 00 you then go on line to our computers to find the debtor and their assets we offer over 120 powerful reports to assist you they range from credit reports from all three credit bureaus to bank account locates employment locates skip traces and locating stocks and bonds etc the prices of our reports are very low typically 1 2 to 1 3 of what other firms charge for example we charge 6 00 for an individuals credit report when some other companies charge 25 00 once you find the debtor and their assets you file garnishments and liens on the assets you have located standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the course when you receive the assets you keep 50 and send 50 to the original judgment holder once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of judgment to the court included in the course quote s from

asked mike miller to assume the leadership of this group in addition mike will continue to manage the power development activities in the eastern interconnect d eastern qf restructuring this group will focus on the qf restructuring opportunities in the eastern interconnect including the existing restructuring and re capitalization of the east coast power assets we have asked dave duran to assume the leadership of this business greg blair formerly of enron asia s development group doug clifford formerly of citizens power and dick lydecker formerly of cogen technology will join this newly formed business 2 commercial transactions the commercial transactions group ctg co headed by ray bowen and jeff donahue was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of transactions within ena and thereby improve ena s efficiency in executing transactions and free up the origination groups to increase their intensity of client coverage ctg consists of six primary functions transaction development capital structuring and portfolio management commodity structuring and transportation transactional support accounting technical analysis and upstream asset management the transaction development group will be responsible for deal leadership execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction with the originator the function will be divided into four teams each of which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups this dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link better service and greater accountability with the origination groups however the ctg resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to the highest value transactions across the coverage functions a midstream transaction development will be dedicated to the eastern and western coverage origination groups the senior members of this group include billy lemmons george mccormick erin norris and russ porter billy lemmons joined enron in 1992 most recently he was the vice president of capital structuring and risk management for ees russ porter joins us today from dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power origination b downstream transaction development will be dedicated to ena s industrial origination efforts in pulp and paper petrochemicals and refining environmental energy metals and mining and other industries as coverage is established the senior members of this team include rodney malcolm jay boudreaux finley biggerstaff and chris helfrich we anticipate announcing two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks c generation transaction development will be dedicated to the ipp merchant services and power plant development and qf restructuring groups the senior members of this team include thomas suffield andy kelemen kelly mahmoud and john house thomas suffield joined enron in 1996 most recently he was the vice president of origination for the latin american group in azurix we anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few weeks d upstream transaction development will be dedicated to the producer finance coal and gas assets groups the senior members of this team include brad dunn john curtin and chris hilgert we hope to announce the addition of at least one vp to this group prior to yearend ray bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the upstream and downstream transaction development teams with jeff donahue having primary responsibilities for the midstream and generation teams andrea reed will continue to head capital structuring and portfolio management all junior commercial resources within the transaction development teams will have dual responsibilities to both their transaction development teams and to the capital structuring group the remaining four groups within ctg will remain largely unchanged in addition the origination and the transaction development teams and their respective origination groups will be located together we believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverage and industry knowledge in all ena s markets particularly in the industrial markets it will also provide a closer partnership and accountability between the coverage origination groups and the ctg groups please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in north america by working with us to implement these changes,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0

648,re storage model simple issues brad here are my thoughts on your concerns you needs curve inputs this is an it job i can help you for the curves before the system is properly set up intrinsic value vs time value the intrinsic value depends on how you allocate the volumes if you have a rough idea about the allocation as you did in the spreadsheet we can calucate the intrinsic value within the model the difference between the total and the intrinsic will be the option time value however by pre allocating volumes you killed some options in the storage model volumes are allocated dynamically therefore it is hard to distinguish the intrinsic vs time value factor of loading factor of loadings are used to give historical correlation matrix the three factors correspond to paralle shift slopping and curveture the covariance matrix in the model is expressed in the form covar row vol i correl i j colum vol j where vols are the implied volatilities from the vol curve correl i j l l residue small where l is the factor of loading matrix so in a simple words the factor of loadings say 60 x 3 are a simplier way for us to remember the historical correlation matrix say 60 x 60 let me know if i can offer further help zimin brad horn 02 15 2000 07 15 am to zimin lu hou ect ect cc sandra henderson hou ect ect subject storage model simple issues zimin thanks for your time with the revised storage valuation your right to point out the similarity to market bids here are some basic questions tied to implementation and calibration model infrastructure it support i obviously need to re build my link to the forward curves as the model is not working in my new location short term aprox 1 month i d like to establish a link to the ena database egsprod 32 in order to fetch the long dated price and volatility curves my link to ena forward curves would then be quickly severed in favor of the curves generated by the new bridgeline entity database name and data structure yet to be defined however its not clear to me what is required in this two stage process to support your model any definition of model input or minimum support requirements you provide is appreciated i ll then work with sandra henderson an enron employee providing our it support to ensure the model continues to work regardless any downstream system changes that may take place as we build and establish our separate trading systems or databases meanwhile is there anything you think you can do to ensure im up and running quickly sandra linking excel spreadsheets to bridgeline forward curves will be key to all our pricing projects not just the storage model supplied by research intrinsic vs extrinsic value it would be helpful to decompose the model s calculated storage price and to distinguish intrinsic vs extrinsic time or option value i could easily link a new spreadsheet tab to your model inputs and to calculate the intrinsic value and then through a simple difference i could determine the extrinsic value ive included a simple spreadsheet calculation for the intrinsic value for review i wanted to share this with you to ask the following does the nature of the model define intrinsic and extrinsic value differently than the simple difference proposed do you think it would make sense to do the simple value decomposition in the backcode c code via dll in order to ensure run time is faster my goal here is straightforward a to better understand the model and its sensitivities and b to determine if and when the option approach is associating significant value above and beyond the simple present value of the time spreads factor loadings what are some of the thoughts or insights you can offer with regards to factor loadings and how i should interpret the graph of the 3 factors calculated factor loadings have always been a mystery to me for example what problems should i be looking for as a warning against mispricing what if anything is implied about 1 day price change or expected curve re shapings after all curve reshapings are key to storage valuation calibration we are preparing a simple summary of descriptive statistics which should allow me to refine some of the model inputs i ll share the data when we are and model results once im up and running,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0

find a code conforming fire barrier for attics crawl spaces etc than lecture on fast and loose applications of code something about 30 cents a bd ft installed meeting all codes and spray applied many companies we talk to have a product that appears to be perfect but they haven t spent the money to test over foam maybe a small committee could do a evaluation of various products report results to spfa who in turn will acquire funding from us 136 2 william b australia we are in australia but we are finding it hard to locate polyurea sprayers here so that we can start a chapter of the pda do u have any list of australian contractors suppliers or maybe they can put their hand up and lets us know at enviroline powerup com au it isfor the betterof the game that an association is need to inform clients and specifiers of the uses and properties of polyureas and train its own members also to keep cowboys out that give the industry a bad name 136 3 ed m i am a writer for aviation magazines and one that i write for is a test international a new publication that just launched this month i need any new processes you might have that would be used on aircraft particularly commercial aviation 136 4 john c louisiana i have a foam cat 2000 graco machine and a probler gun with a 01 tip i use this setup to spray truck bed liners my question is can i and how do i spray foam insulation using my equipment and what are the different types of insulation 136 5 murph mahaffey glas craft i like the new look of the industry forum 136 6 mark w south carolina i m sick of all this garbage about covering foam with a thermal barrier what the hell do you think foam is if you are saying that anything that can be forced to burn should be covered with a fireproof barrier then you d better get busy covering all those trusses and joists and plywood up there that are definitely not carrying a class one fire rating this double standard for foam is coming directly from those who stand to lose business from it icynene is different it doesn t burn alone it doesn t melt it doesn t emit phosgene does it smoke in a fire situation sure so what blaming foam in the attic for a house fire because it forces the foam to eventually burn is about as stupid as blaming foam seat cushions for burning when a gas tank ruptures and burns up a car get real inspectors you want us to cover up the only thing in the attic assembly that doesn t burn as for the vaunted r rating system it is totally bogus the test is designed to make porous insulations appear to perform better than they actually do measuring only conduction and ignoring convection and radiant to convective transfer the test should have been thrown out for the industry lackey it is 20 years ago along with that obsolete fiberglassgarbage they re still selling everybody there s a reason they don t make refrigerators freezers coolers coffee cups out of fiberglass or cellulose think about it 136 7 dirk benthien forum moderator thank you mark and dik for your statements above i also feel that far too often individuals and companies are too complacent and quietly live with rules and regulations without trying to change them even if everybody knows they do not make sense we are all experts and representatives of this industry and should speak up and promote change 136 8 martin s canada does anyone make a

a few people in enron on this subject and get in touch with you our concern right now is that the results of research are widely shared with our competition i am out on the 19 th but the 20 th would work for me i would be glad to cover the cost of your austin to houston trip regarding your son the analyst associate program will interview again on the campus in the spring and they will be more than happy to interview him shmuel oren on 12 19 2000 01 40 02 pm to cc dennis ray subject fw pserc nuggets related to market stem hello vince happy holidays i wanted to connect with you regarding the possibility of enron joining pserc as you might have heard from lance and alex we are going through a transition period having doubled the number of universities and industry members within the last year consequently our business processes are not well developed one of the problems we are facing is the balance between the electrical engineering folks and industry members that are more interested in market related research i hope to recruit more of the later so tat we have more of a constituency in the advisory board that sees the value of market related research i already have a verbal commitment from people at electrabell that expressed interest in joining pserc with members like electrabell and enron we will be able to support more market stem projects such as the one that shijie deng proposed not funded in this round please let me know if i can do anything to facilitate the decision at enron i am going to be in austin on january 19 to participate at a puct hearing and could come through huston for a visit attached are some items that i shared with our pserc members and thought that you might be interested in them as well regards shmuel original message from shmuel oren to power systems engineering research center sent tuesday december 19 2000 9 47 am subject re pserc nuggets related to market stem the following are 3 items that demonstrate the impact of pserc research in the market stem area 1 on december 12 i shmuel oren testified at a hearing in san francisco before the blue ribbon panel chaired by alfred kahn for the that is investigating the implications of uniform price vs pay as bid auctions in the california px as part of my testimony i presented a movie produced by tim mount and bob thomas that show results of an experimental economic study showing how bidders respond by raising their bids in a pay as bid auction following is an acknowledgement i received dear shmuel thank you for attending the blue ribbon panel this past tuesday in san francisco your presentation was very informative and valuable to all the panel members and other participants the panel greatly appreciates your involvement in this important project thanks again natalie efland 2 a recent e mail from the texas puc professor oren i hope you and your family are doing well we are seriously considering your help and advice to facilitate the commission s final decision regarding retail competition in ercot i wanted to let you know that ercot stakeholders filled an application for approval of the ercot protocols in november we received comments including list of issues on november 22 and reply comments on december 1 staff will draft and submit a preliminary order to the commissioners for their discussion on december 13 there will be a pre hearing on december 15 when parties will be asked to brief the commission on list of issues by the end of first week in january there will be a hearing on january 16 followed with another hearing if needed parties have asked the commission to finalize its decision by mid march to give you some more background i have to mention that almost most of your suggestions were accepted and will be reflected in the final protocols except for problems with intra zonal gaming regarding congestion management and pay as bid compensation for selected ancillary services a few additional concerns are raised regarding ancillary services and congestion management stakeholders are still working toward more load participation in ercot market however the main problem is the fact that market pilot that covers 100 of wholesale but only 5 of retail load will be open on june 1 2001 based on a version of the protocols locked on august 1 2000 that was the deadline for ercot to give a final design to anderson consulting that version does not include some of your recommendations to address market design flaws the full version is highly possible to be implemented by january 1 2002 when market for 100 retail competition is scheduled to open given this gap some parties have recommended not to implement incomplete protocols and wait for full implementation by january 2002 in other words they say let s go ahead with 5 pilot retail load but wait for full design implementation before allowing 100 wholesale load and retail load be subject to the rules of the game described in the final protocols thanks parviz adib ph d director of market oversight division public utility commission of texas 1701 n congress avenue p o box 13326 austin texas 78711 3326 ph no 512 936 7365 3 the following is a segment from a published summary of the dec 13 puct hearing this segment describes the commision s deliberation on an agenda item addressing the possibility of instituting price caps as part of the ercot protocols see reference to my involvement in the next to last paragraph docket no 23220 petition of the electric reliability council of texas for approval of the ercot protocols discussion and possible action parviz adib jess totten keith rogas and tammy cooper chairman wood turned to page 2 item number 3 of the draft order identifying issues recommending that the word including be changed to other than in the parentheses he thinks they know the ups and downs of the two mechanisms which are bid caps and price caps but would not mind having parties focus on what other protections might be used commissioner walsh would say including but not limited to because she does not think it is a bad idea for ercot to at least consider in their protocols a fail safe mechanism it s kind of like the stock market suspending trading when something crazy happens they could consider a maximum scenario such as we don t think this will ever happen but if it does we need to muffle it whether it is 1 000 or 99 or whatever it is they could consider whether to put into the protocols a self enacting price cap while not expecting it to happen if it did you don t have to declare it an emergency and have the commission have to act chairman wood asked if they could leave the question without the parenthetical at all and just say what protections should be added to avoid extreme price spikes commissioner walsh reiterated that she wants ercot to think about the unlikely possibility of unacceptable price spikes she would like for them to have their own fail safe mechanism that is self initiating as opposed to leaving that to having someone have to come in and act commissioner perlman stated that he thinks the california type price caps is what the concern is about he thinks everyone in this state is opposed to those but he thinks the point commissioner walsh is making is an interesting one he had not thought about the circuit breaker idea and it might have some merit he agreed that it was worth considering something like that then the question becomes what the level is chairman wood suggested the wording what self implementing protections should be added to avoid the price spikes commissioner perlman said he did not think anyone is talking about 250 price caps commissioner walsh agreed but noted that if the unexpected happens we should be prepared commissioner perlman indicated that if someone is making 10 000 in one particular hour that it probably does not b enefit the market and is probably a windfall to them it is not something they would normally put in their business plan for determining whether they are going to build a plant in texas chairman wood stated that they want to lean toward the market as heavily as they can on these issues chairman wood noted that some of these issues date back to when dr oren was assisting the commission and asked if he could be brought back again staffer dr parviz adib said that staff had already talked to dr

812,re short sell vs exercise chonawee as i have pointed out short selling the stock may be a bad decision because of tax implications ignoring the legal aspects suppose the strike is 70 and you were granted an atm option you sell short at 70 ten lots one lot 100 shares the price goes to 100 you lose 30 x 1000 30 000 on your short position option exercise gives you 30 000 this is before taxes you pay taxes on your option income it s treated as ordinary income the tax is 28 x 30 000 8 400 you can use only 3 000 of your loss against ordinary income this saves you only 840 in taxes of course if you have capital gains you can use losses on your option position as an offset the remaining part of your capital loss is carried forward and you get the tax benefits over time less the time value of money assuming you have income in the future or capital gains not so good by the way valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock options is a very interesting and difficult problem vince chonawee supatgiat enron 07 10 2000 11 40 am to stinson gibner hou ect ect vince j kaminski hou ect ect cc subject short sell vs exercise below is my writing that was originally planned to post somewhere it explains how to handle a special type of call options which can be exercised but cannot be sold as we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call option before its maturity however after taking vince s comments on the ordinary income capital loss tax offsetting issue i think this is not a good article anymore i guess i could just throw this article away chonawee short selling is better than exercising your employee stock options in general the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when you speculate that ene is going down or its growth rate is extremely low in fact when exercising the options you are speculating that ene would never reach this point plus interest again during the 10 years maturity date or until you leave the company if you do not anticipate that you should hold on to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your exercise however if you believe that ene is reaching its peak then instead of exercising the options you should short sell or sell the stocks in that amount after short selling when you feel that the stock starts to go up you can buy them back to cover make profit and still keep the options on the other hand if the stock does not go down as expect you can exercise the options to cover your short position anytime let us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes no dividends and zero risk free rate suppose that ene follows a simple sample path as follow if you exercise 100 ene options with a grant price of 45 when ene reaches 70 you would earn 70 45 100 2 500 but if you short sell 100 ene at 70 no matter how much ene is in the future you can exercise the options to cover the short position and still earn 70 45 100 2 500 the advantage of short selling comes when ene at the period 2 is 60 at this point you can cover your short position get 70 60 100 1 000 and still keep your options or you can exercise the options and gain 2 500 that is you still keep the flexibility of your options when you short sell in conclusion the only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your short position,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0

with the board of dabhol power company authorising the management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board even while international lenders to the project asked enron to renegotiate power purchase agreement signed with the mseb the decision to authorise managing director neil mcgregor to issue notice of termination on the contract to sell 740 mw of power was taken after the board prevented mseb from voting on the ground that it was an interested party the decision was taken with six votes in favour and the single opposition vote was cast by idbi sources said according to reports financial institutions such as anz investment bank credit suisse first boston citibank abn amro and the state bank of india have on wednesday advised enron against terminating its ppa with mseb mseb chairman vinay bansal who with two other directors attended the meeting on wednesday representing maharashtra s 15 per cent stake in the near 3 billion project said the indian side told them that it would be unfortunate if enron broke the contract while bansal declined comment on the board decision the sources said the indian side had expressed its interest to holds talks on the issue rather than terminating the project and there were possibilities of a fresh power purchase agreement between the company and the state pti the economic times friday apr 27 2001 mseb pays rs 134 cr under protest to dpc despite the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head maharashtra state electricity board on thursday made a protest payment of rs 134 crore disputed amount towards march bill of rs 146 64 crore to dabhol we were ready with the payment on wednesday itself but dpc officials could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh a senior mseb official said we have disputed payment of rs 12 64 crore and it would be now taken up at the disputes resolution forum of which enron india managing director k wade cline and krishna rao are members mseb sources said last week dpc had dashed off a communication to the government and mseb that it would not accept protest payments anymore cline had said the energy major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums which mseb in fact owed dpc in full and that the company would also not recognise the purported protest or reservation mseb had paid a rs 113 5 crore february bill in protest last month on april 23 last both domestic and international lenders of dpc had met in london and held exhaustive discussions the multinational s move to issue a termination notice to mseb and state government pti business standard friday april 27 001 enron india md authorised to terminate ppa the board of the enron promoted dabhol power company dpc at its meeting in london on wednesday authorised the managing director of enron india to issue a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the maharashtra state electricity board and the state government the board has authorised wade cline to serve the termination notice however this does not mean that the termination notice will be served immediately it is only an enabling provision and will be used only if the situation arises a state government source told business standard from london he said dpc was under pressure from its lenders the dpc spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue the hardening of the board s stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of dpc s lenders who had warned enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notice the lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not be served at this stage serving of the notice requires a nod from the lenders who have an exposure of about 2 billion in the project sources said given the lenders strong opposition to termination of the contract the enron board s enabling resolution did not have much significance beyond conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio the maharashtra chief minister had warned enron not to scuttle the process of crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice the state government is to nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the dabhol contract enron holds 65 per cent in dpc while us based ge and bechtel hold 10 per cent each the balance 15 per cent is held by mseb through a special purpose vehicle maharashtra power development corporation the mseb representatives were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested party the idbi representative protested against the board s decision the meeting was attended by state energy secretary vm lal the meeting was held against the backdrop of a dispute between mseb and dpc over payment of bills after mseb failed to pay rs 102 crore towards the december 2000 bill dpc invoked the state government s guarantee and then the union government s counter guarantee when payment of the rs 127 crore january bill became overdue dpc again invoked the state government s guarantee mseb retaliated on january 28 2001 by slapping a rs 401 crore penalty for non supply of electricity at adequate levels it demanded that dpc adjust the bills against this penalty this stand of mseb was explained to dpc at the board meeting a state government official said the centre also supported mseb s stand and refused to honour the counter guarantee the power company then invoked the political force majeure clause a process of conciliation and arbitration between the centre and dpc is currently on the financial express friday april 27 2001 foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to dpc sanjay jog raghu mohan global banks comfortable with enron pull out lenders to the dabhol power company dpc are a sharply divided lot international lenders in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones led by the the industrial develoment bank of india idbi are categorical that additional assistance to dpc s phase ii will be held in abeyance despite the completion of 92 per cent of the project work the stage is also set for a preliminary termination notice to be served by dpc to the maharashtra state electricity board mseb within the next four weeks this follows the authorisation given to enron india s managing director k wade cline and dpc president ceo neil mcgregor to serve the termination notice and transfer notices to mseb following wednesday s dpc board meeting in london the essence of the message from the international lenders following the london meeting with dpc board is emotions do not work contractual obligations and payments have to be met we are convinced that the mseb has failed to meet its obligations there is no point in enron continuing with the project and the company should get out of it the structuring of dpc s debt has created two classes of lenders in phase i international lenders are covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phase ii no lender is however all lenders have a parri passu charge making attachment of assets a messy affair sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders to phase ii of the project are worried that an awry dpc project will affect their interests more given that they have no security other than assets like a sovereign cover it was this desperation that made local lenders like idbi slash the interest rates a few months back to 16 5 per cent from 21 5 per cent a leading foreign banker pointed out three points that were made clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were a there are contractual obligations b mseb was not punctual in its payments to dpc and c mseb adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore rebate charge on dpc for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power while local lenders led by idbi with mseb parroting the same were of the view that the current situation is a temporary one international lenders were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out this is despite the stance taken by idbi and mseb that authorisation for termination given to mr cline and mr mcgregor was not called for international bankers pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped in its present form the points of contention are a that phase i of dpc is backed by a sovereign guarantee b phase ii is not and c to the extent that phase ii is covered by assets cancellation of phase ii may see all assets even those under phase i getting attached therefore an examination on the segregation of assets under phase i and phase ii is now warranted pti adds in a significant move dpc board has empowered its management to sever power supply agreement with mseb a move that could inflict a financial liability of about rs 2840 crore on the centre a decision to authorise dpc president neil mcgregor to issue a termination notice to mseb for sale of power was taken by the board at its meeting on wednesday the indian express friday april 27 2001 enron dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the mseb the board of dabhol power company a subsidiary of houston based enron corp has decided to warn the maharashtra state electricity board mseb that it intends to pull the plug on its guhagar based project in a board meeting held in london on wednesday the board decided to authorise dpc president and ceo neil mcgregor and enron india s managing director k wade cline to serve a preliminary termination notice for sale of power to the mseb within the next four weeks the dabhol project has been mired in disputes since mseb began missing payments last year mseb owes dabhol power 48 million for power delivered in december and january the payment ran into a dispute after mseb slapped penalty notices of rs 401 crore on dpc for its failure to supply power within three hours of the demand being placed but mseb has paid 24 million for february and a payment of 31 million was made for march on thursday the 3 billion dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in india to date issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable dabhol to suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputes while a preliminary termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead to the abandonment of the project by enron analysts have described the decision as a procedural move consistent with dpc s negotiating strategy to recover overdue payments from the mseb after the company issues the preliminary termination notice step two would be an official termination notice and step three would be a notice that the company is surrendering control of the project if the project is terminated the government of india will have to take a hit of 300 million besides paying bills of rs 1 500 crore for the next one year to enron as penalty our centre s liability if dabhol power project is terminated would be one year s electricity bill and a termination fee of 300 million power secretary a k basu said contractually the centre will have to pay one year s electricity bill totalling at present prices about rs 1 400 1 500 crore and take over dpc s debt which stands at around 300 million if the project was terminated basu said in delhi dabhol power is in the process of completing the second phase of the 2 184 megawatt power plant project which is 95 per cent through while the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company to get out of the project indian lenders led by idbi are asking the company to reconsider its decision on its termination notice during the meeting in london mseb which holds a 15 per cent stake in the project had strongly opposed dpc s move to authorise cline and mcgregor to issue notices for termination mseb chairman vinay bansal and technical director prem paunikar both directors on the dpc board and the state principal secretary energy vm lal an invitee to the board raised the issue at the board meeting in london mseb claimed that dpc was needlessly threatening to issue various arbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of ppa in isolation in recent weeks dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with the mseb delivering a notice of political force majeure to maharashtra a step typically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war coup or a similar radical political event in this case dpc s move was viewed as a threat to stop providing electricity dpc has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power critics object to the company charging rs 7 1 a kilowatt hour for its power compared with around rs 1 5 a kilowatt hour charged by other suppliers the hindu friday april 27 2001 offer of renegotiation too late enron by mahesh vijapurkar mumbai april 26 the enron sponsored dabhol power company which last night authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its power purchase agreement ppa with the maharashtra state electricity board has decided to keep a stiff upper lip this in turn has stoked speculation that the switching off of power from its phase i plant was imminent while in reality a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the ppa as one source familiar with the ppa told the hindu it is not sudden death of the project and in all probability the dpc vexed with the developments including sharp and pointed observations by the godbole committee has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option this would only eventually come into effect it is not an overnight operation and a lot of legal work is involved apparently the dpc intends to do some arm twisting at the board of directors meeting in london which maharashtra was initially disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contentions on the project the dpc squarely told the mseb nominees on the board that the offer of renegotiation had come rather too late it also said it did not see any room for optimism about the outcome it did not however rule out the option of talks thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to authorise termination was a new weapon the maharashtra chief minister mr vilasrao deshmukh had hoped that dpc would not take any harsh step which would cause lot of damage to the interests of both the independent power producer and the government and today he expressed his dismay in fact the mandate of the team that went on the strength of its stake in the dpc was to put across the idea that negotiation was the requirement and not confrontation echo in ls the enron issue also echoed in the lok sabha today where the power minister mr suresh prabhu said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs 2 840 crores whose liability in the project agreement was limited the centre s liability in case of termination is one year s electricity bill and a termination fee of 300 million blow to fis the termination could prove to be a serious blow to the indian financial institutions fis which under the leadership of the idbi were trying to convince the other lenders of the project against the notice the exposure of indian fis in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee either of the centre or the state the times of india friday 27 april 2001 enron ready to pull out but lenders say wait the dabhol power company board which met on wednesday in london authorised the company management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board the company however may not pull out of the project yet considering its lenders who met on monday opposed such a move and favoured renegotiations sources present during both the meetings said that though foreign lenders supported enron on the termination issue domestic financial institutions led by the industrial development bank of india prevailed over the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move enron needs the lenders consent to file a pre termination notice for pulling out from the project the decision to empower dpc chief wade cline to issue a termination notice was taken with six votes in favour against a single idbi vote against such a move another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the financial institutions made it clear that further funding of phase ii of the project will depend on the government of india assuring payment mechanisms institutions are yet to disburse about 30 per cent of the sanctioned package which is crucial for completing the phase ii expansion project the board has given powers to wade cline to issue a pre termination notice but the meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the project but to initiate serious re negotiation proceedings said mseb chairman vinay bansal who attended the board meeting mseb presented their views to the board members and it was understood by enron which also included the rs 401 crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings we have also made it clear that the tariff structure of enron is quite high and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable bansal added they cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any plans in that direction said a top banker who was present during the lenders meet there is a general consensus that the project must be completed and the proposal to terminate the ppa should be kept in abeyance he added the global arrangers for the dpc include anz investment bank credit suisse first boston abn amro citibank and the state bank of india where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company officials however some bankers said the company can file a termination notice even if one lender with a minimum 5 per cent exposure on the project favours such proceedings meanwhile in a clear reversal of roles maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the ppa we will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that would be bad news for all of us including dpc deshmukh said deshmukh was echoing union power minister suresh prabhu s sentiments who said that the government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row he however added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments and dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the 2 9 billion project would be a blow to india s efforts to woo foreign investors the dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over non payment of dues amounting to rs 213 crore and interest towards the bills due for december 2000 and january 2001 meanwhile mseb officials said in mumbai that the march bills amounting to rs 134 crore was paid on thursday as protest payment despite the dispute over the amount when asked on the future course of action bansal said it was up to the dpc the hindu businessline friday april 27 2001 dpc board authorises md to issue ppa termination notice the board of directors of dabhol power company dpc has authorised the managing director mr neil mcgregor to issue the notice of intent to terminate its power purchase agreement ppa with the maharashtra state electricity board mseb at an appropriate time the decision was taken at a board meeting held in london yesterday while mseb which is an interested party was not allowed to vote it made a presentation clarifying its stand on the matter a senior state government official said the resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice was carried by six votes to one idbi voted against the decision the official said the serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to a six month suspension period according to clause 17 8 of the termination procedure of the ppa following the giving of a preliminary termination notice the parties shall consult for a period of six months or such longer period as they may agree as to what step shall be taken with a view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to all the circumstances idbi and state bank of india the principal indian lenders had earlier persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination notice for some more time at least one lender has to consent for the company to serve termination notice it is understood that overseas lenders are in favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent however domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the ppa is abandoned mid way according to institutional sources indian lenders are trying to get all the parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues the maharashtra and central governments too are in favour of a conciliation mr vilasrao deshmukh chief minister of maharashtra yesterday went on record that the state did not want the project terminated mr yashwant sinha union finance minister is also understood to be of the same opinion the dpc will now have to decide what is the appropriate time to serve the notice the official said mseb pays rs 134 crore meanwhile mseb has paid dpc rs 134 crore towards its march 2001 bill mseb officials confirmed that the bill was paid in protest today morning they dpc had billed us for an amount of rs 146 crore we do not agree with some of the items included a senior mseb official said the pioneer friday april 27 2001 enron testing maharashtra s nerves t n raghunatha dabhol power company dpc has begun to put fresh pressure on the maharashtra state electricity board mseb the maharashtra state government and the centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them if the dpc board of directors decision to authorise its managing director to serve a contract termination notice to the mseb is any indication the dpc board in its meeting in london on wednesday empowered the company management to sever its power supply agreement with mseb a move that could inflict a financial liability of rs 2 840 crore on the centre the decision to authorise the dpc management to issue a termination notice to mseb was taken by a vote of six to one after the maharasthra government representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of interested party when contacted the company s mumbai based spokesperson mr jimmy mogal declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the dpc board we have nothing to say on the reports emanating from london we will express our views after a few days he said however maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh on thursday termed the dpc board s decision as unfortunate we have already requested the company not to take any harsh decision mr deshmukh said in mumbai official sources in the state energy ministry interpreted the dpc board s decision as a pressure tactic employed by the enron subsidiary to force the mseb to clear the pending power bills without any further delay through its tough posture the dpc wants to make its position stronger before it can formally agree for re negotiations with the mseb the centre and the state government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the state electricity board the sources said that the dpc s reported decision to authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the mseb did not mean that the enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrapping of the power contract with the mseb if anything the dpc s reported decision is to mount additional pressure on the mseb for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger position in settling its dispute with the mseb as part of its plan to arm itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its control the dpc had recently served a political force majeure to the mseb the centre and the state government the sources said not surprisingly the dpc s london decision comes on the heels of the maharashtra government s decision to set up a high level committee comprising representatives of the mseb the centre and the state government to re negotiate with the enron s subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the state electricity board meanwhile amidst the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head the mseb on thursday made a protest payment of the rs 134 crore disputed amount towards march bill of rs 146 64 crore to dpc riday april 27 the telegraph friday april 27 2001 enron signal to switch off dabhol power enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversy ridden dabhol power company when it won an authorisation from the company s board to stop sale of power to maharashtra state electricity board mseb the meeting of the company of which the houston based energy giant holds 65 per cent and the mseb 15 per cent was attended by state energy secretary v m lal and mseb technical director p paunikar and it came days after its lenders discussed payment problems and a possible termination the centre s liability if enron decides to snap the agreement will be a year s power bill and a termination fee of 300 million however the company will have to wait for six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls the plug the centre shrugged off the move saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power if enron walks out we do not see fdi inflows into the power sector being hit power minister suresh prabhu said mseb officials said the ball is now in the court of dpc which said its corporate policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board meetings the decision coincided with a rs 134 crore protest payment by the cash strapped power board as part of the march bill worth rs 146 64 crore there was speculation that mseb coughed up the amount to cool frayed tempers at enron s hub in houston and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head mseb officials brushed away the allusions saying the cheque was ready on wednesday but could not be handed over to dpc because of the state wide bandh we have a disputed payment of rs 12 64 crore which will be taken up at the dispute resolution forum a board official said last week dpc told the state government and mseb it would no longer accept protest payments in a move to fortify its legal position mseb officials say bechtel and general electric the other partners who hold around 20 per cent in dpc are willing to go along with enron corp in terminating the deal but financial institutions such as idbi are not game because it puts their loans at risk investments made by indian institutions are not covered under the centre s and state s counter guarantees unlike those made by international lenders maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh called enron s decision unfortunate we had told state government officials attending the enron board meeting to stop the company from winding up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties the statesman friday april 27 2001 enron threatens to pull out the enron crisis deepened with the board of directors of the dabhol power company deciding to authorise the managing director mr k wade cline to serve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the 2 9 billion power project the decision which could lead to the cessation of dabhol s power supply to the state was taken at the meeting held yesterday in london according to reports quoting the chairman of the maharashtra state electricity board mr vinay bansal while dpc officials refuse to comment on anything it is learnt that mseb was itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before the meeting mseb was said to have been dissuaded by the nationalist congress party president mr sharad pawar and union power minister mr suresh prabhu who had talks in new delhi with the maharashtra chief minister mr vilasrao deshmukh and an mseb delegation last monday the state government has been served two arbitration notices while the centre is ready to go for conciliation with the dpc for failing to honour its counter guarantee further the dpc has already slapped a notice of political force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of exigencies that force it to take an extreme step the union power minister mr suresh prabhu contended in delhi that since dpc contributed only 0 7 per cent of the total energy output of the country its termination would not have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation however if terminations proceedings go through enron corp a 65 per cent share holder in the dabhol power company would stand to net a hefty amount in damages the union power secretary has been quoted as saying that termination of the dpc would cost the centre rs 1 800 crore which is the total of one years electricity bill and a termination fee of 300 million according to an energy analyst mr pradyumna kaul the total liability would not cross rs 350 crore however mr prabhu said in the lok sabha today that the that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs 2 840 crore it is learnt that on 20 april mr deshmukh had given the go ahead to the mseb to prepare a legal notice to be issued to enron during the meeting of the dpc s board of directors on wednesday at the meeting the energy minister padamsinh patil energy secretary mr vinay mohan lal and mseb chairman mr vinay bansal were also present the notice was prepared over the past weekend and taken by the delegation when they called on mr prabhu on 24 april however the politicians convinced them that enron would not get tough given its huge stake in the project and that such a notice would not be necessary the meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff with enron s consent among those present at the london meeting were mr lal mr bansal and mseb technical director mr p paunikar in their capacity as directors however they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party the only vote to go against the decision was that of the idbi which is also represented on the board it is learnt the chief minister mr vilasrao deshmukh said the state was not in favour of terminating the project this could mean that the latest manoeuvre to arm twist the indian authorities could achieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over the past three months cleared the mseb owes enron rs 146 64 crore for march 2001 and rs 229 crore for december 2000 and january 2001 the centre today put up a brave face on enron s decision saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power sector in the country pti reported from new delhi there will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domestic or foreign company as far as we are concerned there will be no adverse impact on fdi in power sector power minister suresh prabhu told reporters when asked about dpc s decision to authorise management to issue a termination notice to mseb emphasising that there would be no fallout of such decision prabhu said after the meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs we are expecting cooperation from many scandinavian countries as well as european nations in the power sector in fact not only the power minister but also the prime minister of norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on power and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector mid day dpc may not wind up maharashtra chief secretary v ranganathan has said that though neil mcgregor managing director of the dabhol power corporation dpc has been given complete powers with regard to dpc s operations in the state including the authority to wind up operations it does not necessarily mean that mcgregor will issue such a termination notice mcgregor was given the powers at a meeting of the dpc board in london on wednesday ranganathan said that state officials including maharashtra state electricity board mseb chairman vinay bansal and power secretary v m lal have reported back to him about the meeting in london with regard to the state s failure to pay enron ranganathan said bills are prepared as per the power purchase agreement ppa and dpc owes some money to us our people informed enron officials about this in fact there was no reason to give powers to the md to slap a termination notice in the london meeting mseb and industrial development bank of india idbi representatives insisted that the dpc must pay rs 411 crore since it could not supply power whenever needed chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the decision of the board of the enron promoted dpc to give mcgregor powers to wind up operations deshmukh added we have already requested enron not to take any harsh decision deshmukh had earlier said we have directed state government officials attending the dpc board meeting to desist the energy company from winding up operations in the state as it would be harmful to both of us enron officials are keeping mum on the issue mcgregor said i am not going to give any comment mid day april 27 2001 enron offers no comment on renegotiation h s rao a crucial meeting of the board of directors of the dabhol power company dpc promoted by the us energy major enron was held here yesterday apparently to discuss fate of its 900 million power project in maharashtra but there was no official word on the indian and state governments decision to renegotiate the contract an enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting saying the issues discussed at the meeting were confidential we have not received any direct communication unless we get it and evaluate the details we have no comments to make the spokesman said when asked about the proposed decision on re negotiation of the project in which the maharashtra state electricity board mseb has 15 per cent stake asked whether the board had taken a decision on empowering dpc managing director neil mcgregor to wind up its operations in india the spokesman said he had nothing to say on them enron has reportedly authorised mcgregor to look at various options including selling the company s stake in dpc maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said in mumbai that the state government would pay up the undisputed dues to the company he said the maharashtra government is not in favour of terminating the 2184 mw project but wanted an amicable solution to the imbroglio mid day friday april 27 2001 committee to renegotiate enron deal a committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with the dabhol power company will be appointed by this evening chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said today addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted social reformer anna hazare at his official residence varsha deshmukh said the committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow at the most he termed as unfortunate the enron board decision empowering dpc chief neil mcgregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the maharashtra state electricity board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue with power company renegotiations will be held as per the suggestions made by the godbole committee and the center will also depute its representative on the renegotiating committee we don t want to take any hasty decision deshmukh saidhe pointed that the only bone of contention with the dpc had been its expensive tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicably when pointed that the enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despite state s willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee chief minister said it was unfortunate earlier in his meeting with hazare deshmukh promised to make necessary amendments to the right to information law recently passed by the state so that the information was easily accessed by the common people he also gave a patient hearing to hazare on his complaints of corruption in various state departments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry within three months afternoon april 27 2001 enron s on state govt to renegotiate dabhol power project by hubert vaz the us power giant enron power corporation s willingness to wrap up the dabhol power project and leave the shores may not actually materialise though the dabhol power company chief mr wade cline has been authorised to do so since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the matter disclosing this chief minister vilasrao deshmukh confirmed this morning that the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the power project at dabhol could be continued and at the same time enron did not feel slighted enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision we are waiting for their letter he said when asked what sort of compromise the state government plans to forge mr deshmukh said let our officers come back after that we will decide a future course of action but we are definitely going in for renegotiation of the project it is very difficult to predict the outcome of enron s decision but as of now the project is still on when asked whether the project could be moved to another state if wound up from maharashtra mr deshmukh said that was not possible as per the terms of the agreement between the us company and the state government however it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself he indicated he also confirmed that both parties would face considerable losses if the project was terminated the board of directors of the dabhol power company which met in london on wednesday decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the project once and for all by empowering the dpc chief to terminate the project if he deemed it fit however this decision as of now does not necessarily indicate the death knell for the project the enron project which had been riddled with controversies right from its inception had been a pretext for the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time to time the previous sena bjp government which had been out to terminate the project however chose to continue with it following renegotiations with enron s top visiting officials like ms rebecca mark and the democratic front government inherited the controversial project when the governments changed hands a year and a half ago meanwhile state energy minister dr padamsinh patil when contacted at the osmanabad circuit house said the state government and the central government have decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project with enron it is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like that they will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for both sides he said in case the project is terminated the government can still manage the power needs of the state though it would be a bit tough job he added,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0

premium edition plus quarterly forward price view for 36 months poten explains that 85 of their subscribers take the premium service no one has ever asked for the 10 000 yr long term price forecast i have an interest in a longer term price forecast and hope that it may be useful to others in the corporation the example copies attached include the following special feature articles 99 feb analysis

is 3800 yr as an added service for a total of 10 000 yr poten will include a quarterly update of their 36 month forward view on crude oil and fo prices with a brief justification for their view this would include the standard monthly price forecast for the prompt 12 months and quarterly prices for the following 24 months for far east med and nwe i expect a more descriptive email from poten but i

903,data for moody s riskcalc craig and kim as you know i have obtained a 60 day trial subscription to moody s riskcalc you wanted to know if it makes sense for enron to purchase riskcalc well after plowing through their 100 page manual and sitting through today s 2 hour moody s presentation it is necessary for us to have information about enron s counterparties to move to the next step with riskcalc we have obtained some information on enron s european counterparties from our colleagues in the london office we need for you and or your colleagues in the houston office to supply us with a list of enron s north american counterparties more specifically to evaluate moody s riskcalc we will need the following financial inputs for enron s north american private firm counterparties fiscal year the prior twelve months of financial data are represented annual statements are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables such as cost of goods sold net income sales and ebit the value should be a four digit integer year without mention of the day or month such as 1999 or 2000 forecasts until the year 2009 can be made a constant rate of inflation is applied to future years using last year s 1999 inflation level in general this estimation error will not cause any great problems as size affects default rates at very large scales e g 10 000 000 vs 1 000 000 makes a significant difference 1 000 000 vs 1 050 00 does not cash equivalents this measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities inventory inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet in thousands dollars without any alterations for accounting method e g lifo fifo average cost this item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and supplies purchased for use in production of revenue specifically this would include purchase cost sales cost sales taxes transportation costs insurance costs and storage costs current assets this item primarily represents cash inventories accounts receivables marketable securities and other current assets total assets total assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars for example 15 500 000 should be entered as 15500 specifically total assets are the sum of current assets plus net property plant and equipment plus other noncurrent assets including intangible assets deferred items and investments and advances leave previous year s total assets blank for australian companies current liabilities liabilities are positive values included in current liabilities are short term debt accounts payable and other current liabilities total liabilities this balance sheet account total liabilities is a positive number representing the sum of current liabilities plus long term debt plus other noncurrent liabilities including deferred taxes investment tax credit and minority interest retained earnings retained earnings a historical measure of performance is the cumulative earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders typically it is the prior year s retained earnings plus net income less distributions retained earnings are generally positive some firms with low credit quality will have negative retained earnings leave this field blank for australian companies sales this item consists of the industry segment s gross sales the amount of actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period reduced by cash discounts trade discounts and returned sales and allowances for which credit is given to customers cost of goods sold entered in thousands of dollars this value is generally a positive number less than sales it represents all costs directly allocated by the company to production such as material labor and overhead not fixed overhead or items that would be included in selling general and administrative expenses leave this field blank for australian companies ebit earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation it can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income interest expense this item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short and long term debt typically we expect this charge to be approximately the prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities one measure of computing this is interest expense 0 07 total liabilities net income this item represents the income or loss reported by a company after expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations a loss is represented by a negative sign for example a 5 000 000 loss would be entered as 5000 leave previous year s net income blank for australian companies extraordinary items positive or negative this item represents unusual items that sometimes appear on the income statement the items are designated by the company as extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and discontinued operations these items include extraordinary gains losses income loss from discontinued operations and cumulative affect of accounting changes expenses are entered as negative values gains as positive values leave previous year s extraordinary items blank for australian companies country this model is calibrated for the united states canada and australia we look forward to receiving this information for enron s private firm north american counterparties so that we can move on to the next step with the evaluation of riskcalc thanks

1002,organizational changes to enron north america corp from cliff baxter and kevin hannon in july as part of the enron north america ena reorganization the implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the continued growth of ena including 1 accelerate the development of our people 2 significantly expand our customer network and associated markets and 3 accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups both within ena and across enron consistent with these objectives and with the corporate goal of fostering b the downstream coverage origination groups which focus on delivering a broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers including pulp and paper chemicals plastics refined products metals and mining heavy manufacturing industrial gases fertilizers transportation textiles and glass manufacturing the eastern and western u s midstream coverage origination groups which focus on energy finance and industries downstream coverage origination as energy deregulation continues in north america it is becoming clear that the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both ena and enron corp further it is clear that ena can significantly expand its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of enron corp against this backdrop the downstream coverage origination function will expand its product offering to include not only ena s existing energy commodities energy services finance assets and pulp and paper capabilities but also ees s energy outsourcing capability and global fuel s chemicals plastics and refined products risk management capability these additional capabilities will be offered in conjunction with ees and the global fuels groups given the size and importance of this enron initiative greg piper will be returning from portland to manage this business under greg s leadership the downstream origination effort will be segmented into three sub groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering a pulp and paper edward ondarza will continue to manage the coverage activities in the pulp and paper business this group will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provision of paper risk management products b chemicals plastics and refined products we have asked jim ajello to lead the coverage activities in this business this group will be responsible for the provision of innovative

relocate to portland from calgary where he currently leads the canadian downstream origination efforts c ipp merchant coverage origination this group s activities will focus on the provision of structured energy finance and asset solutions for the emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio s of merchant power generation either through development or acquisition we have asked mike miller to assume the leadership of this group in addition mike will continue to manage the power development activities in the eastern interconnect d eastern qf restructuring this group will focus on the qf restructuring opportunities in the eastern interconnect including the existing restructuring and re capitalization of the east coast power assets we have asked dave duran to assume the leadership of this business greg blair formerly of enron asia s development group doug clifford formerly of citizens power and dick lydecker formerly of cogen technology will join this newly formed business 2 commercial transactions the commercial transactions group ctg co headed by ray bowen and jeff donahue was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of transactions within ena and thereby improve ena s efficiency in executing transactions and free up the origination groups to increase their intensity of client coverage ctg consists of six primary functions transaction development capital structuring and portfolio management commodity structuring and transportation transactional support accounting technical analysis and upstream asset management the transaction development group will be responsible for deal leadership execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction with the originator the function will be divided into four teams each of which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups this dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link better service and greater accountability with the origination groups however the ctg resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to the highest value transactions across the coverage functions a midstream transaction development will be dedicated to the eastern and western coverage origination groups the senior members of this group include billy lemmons george mccormick erin norris and russ porter billy lemmons joined enron in 1992 most recently he was the vice president of capital structuring and risk management for ees russ porter joins us today from dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power origination b downstream transaction development will be dedicated to ena s industrial origination efforts in pulp and paper petrochemicals and refining environmental energy metals and mining and other industries as coverage is established the senior members of this team include rodney malcolm jay boudreaux finley biggerstaff and chris helfrich we anticipate announcing two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks c generation transaction development will be dedicated to the ipp merchant services and power plant development and qf restructuring groups the senior members of this team include thomas suffield andy kelemen kelly mahmoud and john house thomas suffield joined enron in 1996 most recently he was the vice president of origination for the latin american group in azurix we anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few weeks d upstream transaction development will be dedicated to the producer finance coal and gas assets groups the senior members of this team include brad dunn john curtin and chris hilgert we hope to announce the addition of at least one vp to this group prior to yearend ray bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the upstream and downstream transaction development teams with jeff donahue having primary responsibilities for the midstream and generation teams andrea reed will continue to head capital structuring and portfolio management all junior commercial resources within the transaction development teams will have dual responsibilities to both their transaction development teams and to the capital structuring group the remaining four groups within ctg will remain largely unchanged in addition the origination and the transaction development teams and their respective origination groups will be located together we believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverage and industry knowledge in all ena s markets particularly in the industrial markets it will also provide a closer partnership and accountability between the coverage origination groups and the ctg groups please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in north america by working with us to implement these changes,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0

building a relationship with wharton jeff shankman is by the way a great friend of your institution vince companies finance the americas enron sees bricks and bytes mix reshaping energy market purchase of mg only a start in building b 2 b platforms writes hillary durgin companies financial times 16 jun 2000 12 00 00 am 604 words by hillary durgin if jeffrey skilling is right enron s acquisition of mg is only the tip of the iceberg enron s president and chief operating officer is engineering a fundamental strategy shift at the houston energy company aimed at making it a dominant new economy player across various industrial markets the dollars 446 m acquisition last month of mg the uk based metals trader is only the first of more than dollars lbn in estimated new investments the company is targeting it is seeking vehicles on which to build business to business b 2 b platforms in sectors such as logistics chemicals agricultural products and pulp paper mr skilling wants to take the business model the company developed in natural gas and power and apply it to other wholesale commodity markets he argues the electronic platforms it creates will not only become the principal b 2 b sites for those sectors but reshape those industries as an example he points to enron s new e commerce platform enrononline which has changed the way the company does business with its customers while significantly increasing sales the company the largest wholesale merchant of natural gas and power saw wholesale physical deliveries of natural gas surge 53 per cent in the first quarter critics argue that enron s move away from its familiar energy business into new industries where the learning curve is steep and the competition entrenched is risky yet a number of industry analysts point out enron has proved it understands markets and how to manage risks while becoming the largest importer of coal in the uk the largest trader of gas and power in the us and grabbing an advantage in bandwidth it s a prudent strategy but it s got to be done in an orderly way says ronald barone analyst with paine webber in new york what they re doing here is what they ve been incredibly successful at doing he adds noting that enron posted dollars 1 3 bn in earnings before interest and taxes ebit from its wholesale energy and services business in 1999 up 34 per cent from the previous year earnings from that division accounted for two thirds of the company s overall income before interest and taxes last year and mr barone sees the unit s ebit increasing 15 30 per cent annually over several years as with gas and power and now broadband where enron is standardising contracts and creating a market in bandwidth it wants to create markets by entering as a physical player and providing merchant risk management and financial services over the internet we will provide electronic commerce but we will provide liquidity and we will provide settlement or fulfilment of that contract mr skilling says that is an extremely powerful model if you look at other b 2 b sites they don t do that mr skilling argues enron s e commerce platform will triumph over the other bulletin board type exchanges where striking a deal depends on two parties hooking up and working through uncertainties over timing price credit and fulfilment not everyone shares that view some energy companies for example would rather not do business with a competitor bp amoco recently purchased a 3 per cent stake in altra energy technologies a houston based neutral wholesale energy exchange with koch industries and american electric power it also committed to carry out a fixed volume of transactions on the site to lend it liquidity just as in gas and power and now broadband and metals enron believes it needs networks of strategic physical assets in acquiring mg enron got a stable of warehouses lending it a strong physical position it should provide mg with a more vibrant more active physical spot market in more markets in the world says greg whalley chief executive officer of enron net works the new division enron is launching to identify and enter commodity markets he argues that in metals and other markets enron will deliver better pricing price risk management services cross commodity transactions and flexible transactions for a wider range of customers mr

implement a new price cap methodology the new methodology will become effective 11 3 2000 or as soon thereafter as can be implemented caiso staff has indicated that it will be difficult to achieve that start date they have not yet indicated what an achievable date might be the new price cap methodology will remain in place until comprehensive market changes have been implemented and the market has proven to be workably competitive under a variety of load conditions either ferc or the iso board orders its removal cap prices will be based on the average nymex l 3 d settlement average and the following heat rate table load level heat rate 4 00 gas example cap 40 gw 250 mwh 250 mwh caps will be rounded up to the nearest 5 mwh increment demand bids and demand responsiveness programs are exempt from these caps the iso will post the price caps for each load level at least 48 hours prior to the beginning of each calendar month based on the iso s two day ahead system load forecast the iso will post hourly caps at least 24 hours prior to the hour of delivery ferc context ferc has delegated cap authority to the caiso until 11 15 2000 the iso has asserted that they don t need ferc authority since it is a bid cap rather than a sales cap ferc regulates sales not purchases of electricity and therefore can regulate sales prices but not purchase prices the iso has filed with ferc for an extension of the price cap authority ferc has to rule on the filing by 11 18 2000 note that this is 3 days after their authority expires ferc will release its proposed order on 11 1 2000 based on the results of its 206 investigation of the california wholesale power markets we don t know what they will find or what they will propose the proposed order will have a 30 day comment period after which ferc will likely issue a final order ferc will be accepting oral comments on 11 9 2000 in washington enron still has to determine who will provide oral comments many companies have filed at ferc advocating or opposing a litany of price caps cost based rates and market redesign recommendations it is likely that the price caps approved by the iso board will go into effect how long they will remain in effect will depend on whether ferc extends the iso price cap authority and whether the final order stemming from the current 206 investigation stipulates a specific price cap policy impact of price caps the attached spreadsheet contains a table of likely maximum monthly prices at different gas price levels we think that this is the highest that markets would clear since it assumes that each hour clears at the cap it is hard to say whether actual prices would clear significantly lower than the cap because we don t know whether sellers will offer below the cap or at the cap the assumptions behind our analysis are detailed in the bullets below take actual historical loads from 1999 and 2000 calculate implied price cap for each hour using actual historical load new price cap methodology and a range of gas prices divide historical hours into peak and off peak buckets calculate average price for each month for peak hours and off peak hours for example we have two years worth of data for the months of january through september each month has approximately 400 hours for january through september we took approximately 800 observations for each month 400 from each year and calculated a simple average of all of the individual observations we created a peak table and an off peak table the table shows the calculated implied cap based off of the acutal loads at varying gas prices for each month this value represents what the month would clear at if each hour cleared at the cap based on historic loads while any given hour could be above this value our calculation estimates the likely monthly average cap value the blue shading indicates what the caps would be given current 10 27 2000 nymex forward prices the yellow shading indicates those forward power prices which are in excess of the proposed cap,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0

1067,the lure of the san network world fusion focus amy larsen decarlo on storage in the enterprise today s focus the lure of the san 03 14 00 dear wincenty kaminski today s focus the lure of the san by amy larsen decarlo e business is changing how businesses value information information has become a strategic asset that gives companies an edge over their market rivals companies use intelligence to identify new markets and make contact with prospective customers in this media saturated era information itself is packaged and sold as a product this makes the ability to supply users with fast access to stored information on a continuous basis absolutely crucial companies are clearly coming to a crossroads in their storage implementations with estimates for internet storage capacity needs doubling every three months it professionals are hungry for a scalable solution to help them consolidate control of stored information they often look to storage area networks san as a better option to manage their information storage systems than distributed models today most organizations rely on a distributed storage model that uses file servers to process i o requests from end users and other application servers in this model all requests for data go through the file server that owns the attached storage disks and only one file server can tap data on a particular disk via a scsi bus this model has several shortcomings first the amount of data a server can access is restricted to the number of disks supported by the bus which limits the capacity of a single file server second because the server processes each i o request it risks becoming a bottleneck third this server model carries some daunting availability limitations because only one file server is allowed to access a set of disks if that file server or any of its scsi connections fails then users and other application servers lose access to the stored files this model carries other major disadvantages distributed file servers rely on the data transport network to run backup and recovery operations which can eat up bandwidth and slow normal network transmissions to a crawl finally this decentralized setup is difficult to manage from both a logical and a physical perspective file server based storage systems are distributed throughout the enterprise so it is often difficult to assess current and future capacity needs and because these servers use a parallel cabling scheme to link the file server to the disk array they can also be cumbersome to set up and manage sans promise to mitigate the problems that plague conventional file servers largely through consolidation of control these specialized storage networks claim higher availability faster performance centralized management and by their architecture the capability to remove bandwidth intensive data backup and recovery operations from the lan this frees up the lan for normal data communications and ensures smoother back up operations using high speed transports like fibre channel sans offer a high performance network optimized for moving storage data sans also make way for new storage implementations like lan free backup and because fibre channel can support distances of up to 10 kilometers san devices can be widely distributed but also centrally managed as one network yet as was the case with lans in their younger years sans are still developing vendors are still working out major product interoperability issues while companies deploying san technology struggle with how to merge the very different worlds of storage and networks and manage both together ultimately the hope is that like lans sans will develop into a mature and highly manageable solution that supplies substantial benefits at lower costs given that storage deployment and ongoing support costs can total 10 times the acquisition price for the equipment the consolidated management capabilities of a san may deliver the biggest benefit to business to

1110,alliance info alert ferc reporting attached is a summary of recent ferc activities pdf file and the weekly alliance express the following is a summary of the most recent ferc meeting followed by a listing of the most recent ferc filings in a brief meeting yesterday ferc approved a final rule adopting section 203 merger filing requirements generally as proposed and extended the existing nyiso bid cap in its non spinning reserves market and the related mandatory bidding requirement until such time that the new york market can be determined to be workably competitive at the same time ferc ordered a technical conference to explore changes to the nyiso reserves market and urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution next steps and deadlines for resolution implementation additional details are provided below ferc updates streamlines merger filing process ferc unanimously approved its proposed order revising the reporting requirements for mergers however comm hebert did so with reservations as discussed below commission staff stated that the order closely follows the notice of proposed rulemaking previously issued but adds more detail and more certainty to the industry staff stated that the order is improved over the proposed rule because it includes exemptions from reporting for certain entities and it more precisely defines geographical areas and products according to ferc the draft order revises the commission s filing requirements to reflect existing merger policy based on ferc s 1996 merger policy guidelines provides more detail for the industry in developing competitive market analyses the rule continues the existing screening process for mergers with potential horizontal competitive concerns in addition the rule establishes informational requirements for vertical competitive analyses streamlines filing requirements for transactions that do not raise competitive concerns and reduces the industry s regulatory burden by eliminating outdated filing requirements the rule will take effect 60 days after its publication in the federal register commissioner reaction comm hebert expressed reservations that although he was voting for the rule ferc should not be duplicating the department of justice doj and the federal trade commission ftc market concentration analyses and that ferc should follow the lead of anti trust enforcement officials who could also analyze mergers faster and more confidentially he also stated that ferc should review the filings after the doj or the ftc review them not before and that there should be a definite time frame for review hebert did mention that he was pleased that rtos and the disposition of transmission assets would be exempt that ancillary services would be considered as a separate product and that the final rule opens the door for alternative market analysis comm breathitt supported the final rule stating that it should expedite the approval process and that the regulatory burden should be eased due to the fact that older irrelevant requirements have been dropped she indicated that the final rule balanced the need for speedy decisions while protecting the public interest by stating that the process will be efficient yet sufficient the commissioner said that she was pleased the final rule addressed technical issues such as computer modeling as well as retail competition and one of her main concerns confidentiality comm massey fully supported the final rule emphasizing that it would improve response time lessen the need to ask for more data and allow the industry to better predict commission actions like commissioner breathitt massey was pleased that the order will allow market modeling analysis that will better enable ferc to evaluate market concentration and allow applicants to point to other factors when concentration appears too high massey also stated that the new rule includes the ability to address many of ferc s concerns such as future mergers when they occur in succession retail competition mitigation by the enlargement of markets through rtos and analysis of ancillary services in sum he averred that the order will provide ferc with the tools it needs for accurate analysis while taking into consideration the rapid changes in the industry chairman hoecker also voiced his support and noted that he felt that this was a very important rule in response to comm hebert chairman hoecker said that the doj and ftc actually wait for ferc s report before issuing their own that the anti trust enforcement agencies rely on ferc s expertise when reviewing mergers in the electric and gas industries there is a major positive connection between industry consolidation and rtos and that both are reconfiguring the markets and effect how they work he noted because the rtos enlarge the size of the subject market he indicated rtos will help to preserve competition therefore more and larger rtos should allow for more mergers he said the chairman cautioned that this is not to imply that joining an rto is a requirement for a merger but that it would certainly be viewed favorably nyiso bid caps extended until ancillary service market shown to be workably competitive in a 3 1 decision with comm hebert dissenting ferc extended the existing nyiso bid cap in its non spinning reserves market and the related mandatory bidding requirement until such time as that market can be determined to be workably competitive at the same time ferc ordered a technical conference to explore changes to the nyiso reserves market and urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution next steps and deadlines for resolution implementation in so doing ferc rejected certain aspects of nyiso s september 1 and 8 2000 compliance filing submitted pursuant to its may 31 2000 order imposing a temporary bid cap through october 31 the iso s efforts to correct market flaws identified in the order and further strengthen market performance had not yet satisfied the commission s directives ferc concluded ferc found that while nyiso has achieved solid progress in certain areas overall the iso has not shown sufficient improvement to warrant raising and then gradually lifting the temporary bid cap in the iso s non spinning reserve market by april 2001 as the iso requested commissioner reaction comms hoecker massey and breathitt all endorsed the order as an imperfect solution yet a pragmatic approach toward resolving the flaws plaguing the iso s market comm hebert faulted the commission for squandering an opportunity to incentivize additional supply by lifting the price controls hoecker and breathitt joined hebert in expressing disappointment in the lack of the iso s progress but contended that significant outstanding issues must be resolved before the bid cap can be lifted in other action ferc accepted nyiso s and nepool s proposed emergency energy transaction agreement

1118,points for singh meet vince please find below a note i had prepared for wade cline who is meeting with a representative of the prime minister s office tomorrow i think you may find these points useful additionally i am attaching a copy of a small presentation i made saturday in mumbai on roadblocks in the power sector with special reference to wat needs to be done to start trading its benefits i have been working with the henwood team that arrived today and i think a good part of the data is now in place i will be arranging meeting with some officicals from the transmission side and gather any additional data there too krishan got in last night i conveyed your best wishes to him we will hopefully have a useful day with henwood folks tomorrow i look forward to being in houston possibly by the end of the coming week hope you and the team are doing well regards sandeep forwarded by sandeep kohli enron development on 01 15 2001 01 17 am sandeep kohli 01 15 2001 01 17 am to wade cline enron development enron development cc subject points for singh meet wade please find below a brief note on what i feel your tack should be with n k singh who is supposed to be a hard negotiator i am assuming here that this will be more of an introductory meeting where both sides are feeling out the other the two meetings i had arranged over the weekend would hopefully have given you a better idea of the thinking of at least these two people o the issue incidentally in the indian system the governor of any state is a central government nominee he is the eyes and ears of the central govt in the state please see basak s meeting in that light the message he takes will likely go directly to the pmo in delhi i will therefore be working closely to convey the right impression for n k singh clearly there are three things you would try to convey a description of the problem some of the resultant consequences if it is not solved soon enough and conveying the fact that there are win win solutions well within the goi s power to implement that would in fact enhance his reputation and the country s as one that lives up to its reputation i would be careful to make the point that we are not going to give up any value but are willing to be accomodative to mseb gom and goi needs either through financial re engineering or through getting direct access to the market in some areas this will also fly well with enron management that is more comfortable with market risks than political describing the problem dpc has a ppa backed by goi mseb s monthy collections not improving are in the range of rs 900 cr month mseb and gom clearly do not have the resources in the short run 3 5 yrs to meet these obligations hence central intervention is needed in a grid of 13000 mw maharashtra grid size absorbing an additional 1440 mw phase ii at one go is difficult however if we take western region grid size is 42000 mw clearly absorbing all the power in that framework is much easier to this if we add northern and southern grids we can probably evacuate out another 500 700 mw through the interconnects hence there is definitely value in looking at this issue at a national level additionally it is not just solvable at that level but actually answers to the crying need for power in the country and hence is a boon for the govt and should be treated as such consequences of not solving the problem we can call upon the sovereign guarantee which will cover our partial payments however this would almost definitely lead to a deterioration of the country s credit rating put back incoming investments into the petroleum sector where private participation program is about to be unveiled in 25 o we need to get someone to negotiate with please use your good offices to quickly form a representative group that includes central state govt and seb representatives so that we can work on the solution without active participation from pm s office we are likely to waste precious time bouncing between the seb gom and various ministries of goi hope this helps regards sandeep,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0
1119,dhabol jeff we shall forward to you shortly a copy of the message from sandeep with the numbers you have requested what follows below are the extracts from two recent articles on the power situation in india published by the financial times the first article describes recent power outage in northern india affecting millions of people one possible line of defense is pointing out to the value of output lost due to power shortages it is obvious that the value of lost production exceeds the cost of power produced by the dhabol plant expensive as it may be the power cut affected 230 million people the second article is enron specific vince asia pacific power failure hits north india financial times jan 3 2001 by angus donald tens of millions of people were left without electricity in northern india yesterday after a power grid breakdown electricity was gradually switched on in some areas and most parts of the capital new delhi with 60 to 70 per cent of supply expected to be restored by the end of the day according to power grid officials the associated chambers of commerce and industry assocham a leading business organisation expressed deep concern and called for a mechanism to prevent future disruption that could cripple the economy the power failure across eight indian states including new delhi disrupted train services water supplies and the telephone network and forced hospitals to switch to emergency generators the fault occurred on the northern grid which provides electricity for 226 m people and affected the states of delhi haryana punjab uttar pradesh himachal pradesh madhya pradesh rajasthan and jammu and kashmir a breakdown at a sub station in kanpur in uttar pradesh india s most populous state caused an overload of power on other lines which then failed as well trains stopped running for most of the day and signals systems were damaged new delhi international airport was also slightly affected before its own power supply could be engaged we will probe into the reasons for the failure it is most likely to be a technical failure but we will investigate why it happened suresh prabhu the power minister was quoted as saying by press trust of india india suffers regularly from power problems because of lack of funding to upgrade infrastructure theft of supplies is also a big problem thirty per cent of the country s electricity is stolen according to analysts in new delhi as much as 50 per cent is stolen two years ago a power failure blacked out uttar pradesh and delhi for hours assocham issued a statement saying that increasing industrial demand would exacerbate the problems already faced by india s inefficient power sector the slow progress particularly in strengthening the transmission and distribution system and ever increasing theft will contribute to worsening the power supply situation further copyright the financial times limited copyright the financial times limited 2000 ft and financial times are trademarks of the financial times privacy policy terms jan 3 2001 by khozem merchant enron the us energy producer and a constant target of criticism in india is hitting back with a campaign to reverse its image as a profiteering multinational its myth and reality offensive in local newspapers follows the west indian state of maharashtra s decision to review the tariff it pays the texas based company whose dollars 2 2 bn electricity generating plant at dabhol is india s biggest single foreign investment maharashtra s tariff has more than doubled since 1993 and is three times greater than that charged by other independent power producers ipps the tariff has risen because of the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar and the high but now falling price of naphtha fuel the state also pays a fixed capacity charge of rs 970 m dollars 21 m a month reflecting the huge project cost and controversially irrespective of consumption a showdown looks inevitable reminiscent of a clash six years ago that damaged india s appeal to foreign investors a former official of the world bank which has criticised the deal says enron is emerging as the east india company of the 21 st century a reference to the british trader that colonised key areas of the indian economy in the 19 th century the stand off is the latest blot on india s power sector the uk s powergen and cogentrix of the us have quit india recently frustrated by long approval procedures inadequate payments mechanisms or because of higher returns elsewhere india has lost time and opportunity and has driven returns down by six percentage points says gerry grove white former india general manager of powergen which has sold its 655 mw plant in gujarat to china light power of hong kong india s national plan for the five years to 2002 says generating capacity must rise by 40 000 mw to about 120 000 mw but since 1992 ipps have added only 3 000 mw and 2 500 mw remains under construction this is insufficient to support official projections of 6 to 8 per cent economic growth enron was a bellwether of india s liberalisation winning fast track project approval in the early 1990 s phase 1 a 740 mw plant fuelled by expensive naphtha came on stream in may 1999 and phase 2 a dollars 1 87 bn plant of 1 624 mw capacity that will run on cheaper liquefied natural gas lng will be completed this year only two of seven other fast track proposals have achieved financial closure from the outset enron encountered attacks culminating in maharashtra s then nationalist government cancelling the project before renegotiating terms no less onerous vilasrao deshmukh chief minister of the successor government says the power purchase agreement is unaffordable enron whose attackers also include cultural chauvinists wants to maintain good political relations in a hostile but lucrative environment enron views india as a testing ground for its evolution from a traditional manager of power plants to a broad based trader of commodities such as energy gas and bandwidth to support these ambitions enron hopes to trade energy between power surplus and deficit states once legislation is passed this year it is building an lng terminal and pipelines to trade imported natural gas and it is laying a 15 000 km fibre optic network to trade bandwidth space in a country desperately short of this new economy commodity in any event enron believes it has a watertight contract it is supported by many that believe any subversion of the contract would confirm investor perception of maharashtra india s financial and industrial hub as an unreliable destination for investment mr deshmukh who has avoided the language of his predecessor which threatened to dump dabhol into the arabian sea is under pressure from radical members of his wobbly coalition but his options are limited scrapping the project would be ruinous for an economically troubled state that would have to compensate shareholders maharashtra state electricity board the local utility and enron s main client is obliged to dispatch or off take 90 per cent of dabhol s output yet mseb has never honoured these guarantees its off take has averaged 60 per cent since the plant opened and in effect mseb has been paying a lot more while consuming a lot less power one reason off take is low is because the state s tough new regulator has told mseb to buy from cheaper sources enron says the tariff would be rs 4 02 kwh if mseb s off take averaged 90 per cent but with off take a third lower the average tariff is rs 4 94 per unit and often higher in october the tariff was rs 6 91 per unit when off take was about 49 per cent enron says tariffs should come down when phase 2 run on cheaper lng starts these cost pressures have forced mseb to take up only half of a 30 per cent equity option in phase 2 enron has acquired the balance and mandated bankers to find a buyer enron s difficulties have undermined the appeal of ipps which have failed to deliver the flood of investments potential ipps feared they would never be paid by state generating boards that have become a byword for corrupt management of power reform of state electricity boards whose uneconomic pricing means industrial users subsidise poor farmers as well as transmission and distribution t d services to check huge theft and technical losses is overdue given the limited resources money would be better spent on t d rather than on new plant says oliver blackaby managing director of n m rothschild in india which is advising karnataka on the privatisation of its distribution network for the moment attention is fixed on enron s ability to satisfy the competing interests of investors and clients as sanjay bhatnagar chief executive officer of enron india said in a recent trade magazine one of the key lessons learned from phase 2 is having flexibility to deal with externalities copyright the financial times limited copyright the
