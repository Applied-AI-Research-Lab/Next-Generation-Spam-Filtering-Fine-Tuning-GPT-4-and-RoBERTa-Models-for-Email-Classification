cme and catex forwarded by joseph hrgovcic hou ect on 04 05 2000 04 06 pm lucy ortiz 04 05 2000 04 02 pm to joseph hrgovcic hou ect ect cc subject cme and catex spotlight report exchange products seeing slow trading gavin souter 03 20 2000 business insurance page 3 copyright c 2000 crain communications inc all rights reserved exchange based insurance products developed in recent years have been somewhat slow to get off the ground although several exchanges have offered derivative contracts since the mid 1990 s to cover insurance risks none so far has posted a significant volume of trades few insurers reinsurers or policyholders have been drawn away from the traditional insurance markets where capacity remains abundant and relatively cheap as long as those traditional markets manage to weather major natural catastrophes the allure of the exchange based products will remain limited observers say also stifling the growth of the exchange based contracts is the limited number of contracts available one expert noted dealers he said are unable to secure a suitable hedge by laying off one contract against another although the various exchanges have had a good opportunity to establish a widely used set of new risk financing products that has not been achieved said morton lane senior managing director capital markets division at gerling global financial products in new york the main problem with the existing exchanges is that they do not offer a sufficiently diverse array of products he said the only way to control the risks in the catastrophe options is to have a diversified portfolio of other contracts and none of the exchanges currently offers a sufficiently broad range of options to provide for that hedge he said florida windstorm options for example cannot be bought and then hedged in the same way that international business machines corp stock options contracts can be hedged with ibm stock mr lane explained the exchanges might be more attractive to investors if in addition to natural catastrophe options they included options on other risks he said those might include for example satellite aviation and crop indexes mr lane said for the insurance buyer such exchange instruments would not represent the perfect risk transfer vehicle but as long as they are quantifiable and indexable they may represent a good surrogate he said the exchanges could also be used to create a derivatives market for over the counter securitized deals if there are regular issuers of catastrophe bonds mr lane said the soft insurance market has also hindered the growth of exchange based insurance products said sean f mooney senior vp and chief economist at guy carpenter co the reinsurance brokerage unit of marsh inc in new york the traditional market has been so competitive that people are not looking for other ways of doing business he said at least in concept the exchange based deals are generally similar to the mortgage backed securities that have been a huge success since they were introduced in the 1970 s there is a belief that alternative means of transferring risks will grow but it is difficult to predict when mr mooney said currently the trading that is taking place typically involves established insurers and reinsurers so the exchanges have not brought substantial new capacity to the marketplace he said guy carpenter provided the index for the bermuda commodities exchange reinsurance products the bce did not take off however and was suspended last year after two years of little activity the oldest of the insurance related exchange based derivative products are the catastrophe options traded on the chicago board of trade which began trading the options in 1996 initially there was substantial interest in the options but the soft traditional market has hampered use of the contracts to hedge catastrophe exposures said carlton purty an independent broker at the cbot who trades in options no catastrophe option trades have been completed at the cbot so far this year he said last year there was increased interest in the contracts because of hurricane floyd but few contracts were traded mr purty said i think a major major catastrophe will have to happen before they really take off he said the contracts offer real protection and options dealers are keen to trade in a new niche but the conventional insurance and reinsurance markets are so soft that few companies are turning to alternative coverage options mr purty said the catastrophe risk exchange located in princeton n j has radically changed its structure since it was originally announced in mid 1996 and it is well positioned to expand said frank sweeney chief operating officer catex initially planned to be a computer based facility for reinsurers that would enable them to exchange catastrophe risks and to build balanced portfolios but by the time the exchange was operational in november 1996 it was clear that most reinsurers and insurers interested in catex wanted only to buy and sell conventional reinsurance mr sweeney said although there was some interest in risk swapping only a handful of risks were posted on the system and none was traded mr sweeney said consequently catex has become chiefly a cash for cover exchange he said noting that the risks reinsured on the exchange include property catastrophe coverage aviation and liability coverages catex also trades industry loss warranties where coverage is triggered by an actual loss combined with an industry loss over an agreed threshold other adjustments to the exchange included making it accessible through the internet in november 1998 and late last year catex offered users the ability to set up smaller networks allowing them form groups whose members do business only with one another since its inception catex has completed about 450 trades totaling 400 million in premium and more than 3 billion in limits he said catex s roughly 160 subscribers include reinsurers insurers and corporate entities that purchase coverage through their captives mr sweeney said we obviously have a long way to go but we are pretty satisfied with what we have achieved so far mr sweeney said the exchange sees increased activity after major losses as cedents seek to buy replacement coverage to offset depletions in their existing cover he said for example mr sweeney said there was a flurry of activity after the european windstorms in december last year last september the chicago mercantile exchange entered the field of insurance related derivatives when it began offering weather derivatives thus far 420 futures contracts have been traded said larry grannan senior director in product marketing at the cme such contracts are designed to allow businesses to hedge against weather related losses for example a utility may sell less power in a mild winter and it would be able to use the futures to hedge a resultant fall in revenues the exchange first offered heat based indexes for atlanta chicago cincinnati and new york in january it added philadelphia dallas des moines las vegas tucson and portland and it began offering contracts based on cold weather currently most of the trades are between securities dealers themselves but eventually the contracts will likely be used more extensively by utilities and insurers mr grannan said in addition the futures contracts could be used as hedges for over the counter securitized deals he said copyright 2000 dow jones company inc all rights reserved,0

combinatorial auction jan 11 mtg background forwarded by greg woulfe enron communications on 12 28 00 09 58 am chonawee supatgiat enron 12 22 00 05 08 pm to stinson gibner hou ect ect greg woulfe enron communications enron communications cc subject combinatorial auction stinson and greg i have read the paper combinatorial auction with multiple winners for universal service from richard steinberg and frank kelly they propose a combinatorial auction which is an auction for multiple items that allows bidders to realize their synergies on combinations of items the combinatorial auction is appropriated for bandwidth commodity because most bidders in the market have synergies on the combination of items for example if we want to get bandwidth between boston and dc we would bid for boston ny and ny dc it will be valuable to us only if we won both links if we won only one link it will be useless in the paper they propose the auctioning method but their method has not been tested or validated yet i have not checked their proposition mathematically but their paper was published in management science so i think it should be all right i will look at it in more details and let you know anyhow there are also other combinatorial auctions that are actually used for example the alberta government s ppa auction that enron canada was participated 3 4 months ago based on our long position on bandwidth auction and exchange might be a good channel to dispose our unused or unsold bandwidth i know there is not much demand in the market but if we open a combinatorial auction or exchange we might be able to increase our market share by taking demand from our competitors i believe at the moment there are no bandwidth exchanges that allow combinatorial bids if we are the first one to do it we might improve our sale channel and gain some market share note auction one seller and many buyers exchange many sellers and many buyers moreover i think auctioning the unsold bandwidth will not hurt us because we cannot sell them anyway in addition we ourselves can be a dummy bidder in the system and bid in the auction if the current wining bid is too low we can just over bid it and keep the product this way we can indirectly put a reserve price on the products let s meet sometime in the first week of january chonawee,0
credit support value for mg and paperco find below a spreadsheet with my very rough calculation of the value of credit support for mg and paperco my approach is as follows 1 assume all contracts can be modelled as financial swaps 2 spread the notional trading volumes over the estimated swap tenors 3 calculate the value of defaulting at each period of the swap the default option using black s formula 4 treat the value of the default options as risky cash flows that is treat this value just like you would an annuity stream by discounting back this stream of cash flows at the original risky rate and at the risk reduced rate i find the value of credit enhancement as the difference in the two npv s please give your comments especially if this makes no sense to you stinson,0

a better investment than the stock market all our mailings are sent complying to the proposed h r 3113 unsolicited commercial electronic mail act of 2000 please see the bottom of this message for further information and removal instructions parents of 15 year old find 71 000 cash hidden in his closet does this headline look familiar of course it does you most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program usa and reported elsewhere in the world including my neck of the woods new zealand his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15 year old sons closet nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash five dollar bills twenties fifties and hundreds all neatly rubber banded in labelled piles my first thought was that he had robbed a bank says the 41 year old woman there was over 71 000 dollars in that bag that s more than my husband earns in a year the woman immediately called her husband at the car dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered he came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet as it turns out the boy had been sending out via e mail a type of report to e mail addresses that he obtained off the internet everyday after school for the past 2 months he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom i just got the e mail one day and i figured what the heck i put my name on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out says the clever 15 year old the e mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one 5 dollar bill to each person on the list then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down and finally to add your name to the top of the list the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5 address list i get junk e mail all the time and really did not think it was going to work the boy continues within the first few days of sending out the e mail the post office box that his parents had gotten him for his video game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines but envelopes containing 5 bills about a week later i rode my bike down to the post office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it there was also a yellow slip that said i had to go up to the post office counter i thought i was in trouble or something laughs he goes on i went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me i had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all over the next few weeks the boy continued sending out the e mail the money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet barely had time for my homework he had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the 5 bills for twenties fifties and hundreds i didn t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack i would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me one time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it but i just rode to the next bank down the street laughs surprisingly the boy did not have any reason to be afraid the reporting news team examined and investigated the so called chain letter the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain letter at all in fact it was completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws title 18 section 1302 and 1341 or title 18 section 3005 in the us code also in the code of federal regulations volume 16 sections 255 and 436 which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received every five dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read please send me report number xyx this simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service a report on how to for a five dollar fee this is the end of the media release if you would like to understand how the system works and get your 71 000 please continue reading what appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net you can use it too just follow the simple instructions be financially free like others within a year before you say bull please read the following this is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately due to the popularity of this letter on the internet a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below to see if it really can make people money the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions they are bound to make some megabucks with only 25 out of pocket cost due to the recent increase of popularity respect this program has attained it is currently working better than ever note follow the directons below i had best results the second time when i hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions in order for all of us to be successful many many emails must be sent so that the returns are many i have been extremely successful using the following company they send out the offers and all i do is accept money for reports then i send back to the people as soon as possible this is what one had to say thanks to this profitable opportunity i was approached many times before but each time i passed on it i am so glad i finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required to my astonishment i received total 610 470 00 in 21 weeks with money still coming in pam hedland fort lee new jersey here is another testimonial this program has been around for a long time but i never believed in it but one day when i received this again in the mail i decided to gamble my 25 on it i followed the simple instructions and walaa 3 weeks later the money started to come in first month i only made 240 00 but the next 2 months after that i made a total of 290 000 00 so far in the past 8 months by re entering the program i have made over 710 000 00 and i am playing it again the key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and not change anything more testimonials later but first print this now for your future reference order all 5 reports shown on the list below for each report send 5 cash the name number of the report you are ordering and your e mail address to the person whose name appears on that list next to the report make sure your return address is on your envelope top left corner in case of any mail problems when you place your order make sure you order each of the 5 reports you will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer within a few days you will receive vie e mail each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 000 s of people who will order them from you also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer important do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report or their sequence on the list in any way other than what is instructed below in step 1 through 6 or you will loose out on majority of your profits once you understand the way this works you will also see how it does not work if you change it remember this method has been tested and if you alter it will not work people have tried to put their friends relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money but it does not work this way believe us we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed because if you do it will not work for you remember honesty reaps the reward 1 after you have ordered all 5 reports take this advertisement and remove the name address of the person in report 5 this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune 2 move the name address in report 4 down to report 5 3 move the name address in report 3 down to report 4 4 move the name address in report 2 down to report 3 5 move the name address in report 1 down to report 2 6 insert your name address in the report 1 position please make sure you copy every name address accurately take this entire letter with the modified list of names and save it on your computer do not make any other changes save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data to assist you with marketing your business on the internet the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e mails legally where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more there are 2 primary methods to get this venture going method 1 by sending bulk e mail legally let s say that you decide to start small just to see how it goes and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5 000 e mails each let s also assume that the mailing receive only a 0 2 response the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0 2 also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e mails instead of only 5 000 each continuing with this example you send out only 5 000 e mails with a 0 2 response that is only 10 orders for report 1 those 10 people responded by sending out 5 000 e mail each for a total of 50 000 out of those 50 000 e mails only 0 2 responded with orders that equals 100 people responded and ordered report 2 those 100 people mail out 5 000 e mails each for a total of 500 000 e mails the 0 2 response to that is 1000 orders for report 3 those 1000 people send out 5 000 e mails each for a total of 5 million e mails sent out the 0 2 response to that is 10 000 orders for report 4 those 10 000 people send out 5 000 e mails each for a total of 50 000 000 50 million e mails the 0 2 response to that is 100 000 orders for report 5 that s 100 000 orders times 5 each 500 000 00 half million your total income in this example is 1 50 2 500 3 5 000 4 50 000 5 500 000 grand total 555 550 00 numbers do not lie get a pencil paper and figure out the worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate it you will still make a lot of money remember friend this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of 5 000 you mailed to dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4 th of those people mailed 100 000 e mails each or more there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting believe me many people will do just that and more method 2 by placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response we strongly suggest you start with method 1 and add method 2 as you go along for every 5 you receive all you must do is e mail them the report they ordered that s it always provide same day service on all orders this will guarantee that the e mail they send out with your name and address on it will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report order each report by its number name only notes always send 5 cash u s currency for each report checks not accepted make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper or aluminum foil on one of those sheets of paper write the number the name of the report you are ordering your e mail address and your name and postal address place your order for these reports now report 1 the insider s guide to advertising for free on the net order report 1 from r r po box 18048 chicago il 60618 report 2 the insider s guide to sending bulk e mail on the net order report 2 from gm boland 353 jonestown rd suite 125 winston salem nc 27104 report 3 secret to multilevel marketing on the net order report 3

out one million emails for free order report 5 from l samon po box 31 castletown isle of man im 99 5 xp your success guidelines follow these guidelines to guarantee your success if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report 1 within 2 weeks continue sending e mails until you do orders 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for report 2 if you did not continue advertising or sending e mails until you do once you have received 100 or more orders for report 2 you can relax because the system is already working for you and the cash will continue to roll in this is important to remember every time your name is moved down on the list you are placed in front of a different report you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you if you want to generate more income send another batch of e mails and start the whole process again there is no limit to the income you can generate from this business following is a note from the originator of this program you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life with no risk and just a little bit of effort you can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined follow the program exactly as instructed do not change it in any way it works exceedingly well as it is now remember to e mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in report 1 and moved others to 2 thru 5 as instructed above one of the people you send this to may send out 100 000 or more e mails and your name will be on every one of them remember though the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach so my friend i have given you the ideas information materials and opportunity to become financially independent it is up to you now more testimonials my name is mitchell my wife jody and i live in chicago i am an accountant with a major u s corporation and i make pretty good money when i received this program i grumbled to jody about receiving junk mail i made fun of the whole thing spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved i knew it wouldn t work jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet i made merciless fun of her and was ready to lay the old i told you so on her when the thing didn t work well the laugh was on me within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses within the next 45 days she had received total 147 200 00 all cash i was shocked i have joined jody in her hobby mitchell wolf chicago illinois not being the gambling type it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan but conservative that i am i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i wouldn t get enough orders to at least get my money back i was surprised when i found my medium size post office box crammed with orders i made 319 210 00 in the first 12 weeks the nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live there simply isn t a better investment with a faster return and so big dan sondstrom alberta canada i had received this program before i deleted it but later i wondered if i should have given it a try of course i had no idea who to contact to get another copy so i had to wait until i was e mailed again by someone else 11 months passed then it luckily came again i did not delete this one i made more than 490 000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks susan de suza new york n y

in visiting enron to give a talk on work he is doing in the broadband area please see the forwarded emails for further information and available dates can you let me know if we can give him a forum at one of our thursday research lunches or a friday brown bag lunch thanks iris original message from nalin kulatilaka enron com sent thursday march 29 2001 5 40 pm to mack iris cc lin martin subject re possible visit to enron by professor nalin kulatilaka of boston university hi iris i have two different hats to wear in talking to enron one is as a financial economist the other as the director of the newly formed global mobility innovation initiative gmii this is the research project funded by lucent involving bu lbs and insead to study various aspects of the mobile internet read 3 g on the former i am working with a couple of ph d students in understanding a details of how having physical supply inventory can be used by a market maker this is a problem that has been studies in the context of specialists inventory in the stock market but i think really interesting in the way enron does it in some of the newer markets like bandwidth i think this is a big issue in lighting up all the dark fiber that is in the ground b how enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with market this is in many ways the critical aspect of real options that most finance people miss having options is one thing but exercising them and realizing their value is another all of the incomplete contracting asymmetric information and incentive issues are ignored in real options valuation models but they are real in practice my impression is enron s real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate these problems by imposing a market disciplining c how enron manages the various books that involve physicals financials credit etc this is specially important when many of the real assets have options features and therefore include non linear risk profiles the story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets enron has been moving into over the last few years on the gmii front i think that some interesting opportunities arise when you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber i am working with several people at lucent on this issue i think it would be wonderful to engage in a conversation with enron and lucent folks in the room i can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues perhaps we can discuss some of these over a conference call clearly having vince kaminski in the room would be very important to me as for schedules the first 3 weeks of april are horrible april 26 27 may 3 4 are good for me regards nalin at 06 56 pm 03 22 2001 mack iris wrote hi as we briefly discussed i spoke with one of my colleagues dr martin lin about your visiting enron to give a talk and to spend some time with us to discuss you work in telecommunications real options etc martin and i are working on various broadband related problems we thought it might be helpful if you let us know a bit more about the following when you want to come the research group has weekly catered lunch on thursday and brown bag lunches on every other friday a description of what you want to talk about with respect to telecoms broadband etc who you would like to meet with me vince kaminski our boss any other of our colleagues

second language the corrections are in pink vince see attached file introo 802 doc julie on 08 01 2000 07 43 10 am to vincejkaminski cc subject preface for book vince hope you are well we spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book and you kindly offered that you would provide this is this still possible we realise that you are extremely busy so chris and les went ahead and wrote something which is below and if you want to review change or re write the preface that would be very appreciated let me know what your thoughts are thanks julie we re getting close preface one of our main objectives in writing energy derivatives pricing and risk management has been to bring together as many of the various approaches for the pricing and risk management energy derivatives as possible to discuss in depth the models and to show how they relate to each other in this way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models price a wide range of energy derivatives or to build a risk management system which uses a consistent modelling framework we believe that for practitioners this last point is very important and we continue to stress in our articles and presentations the dangers of having flawed risk management and giving arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using ad hoc and inconsistent models for different instruments and markets see also others who propose consistent models however it is not our wish to concentrate on one particular model or models at the exclusion of the others because we believe that the choice should rest with the user although it will probably be clear from our discussions the model s we prefer we therefore try and give as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of all the models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models which best suit their needs in order to meet our objectives the book is divided into 11 chapters in chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the book in addition to introducing the techniques that underlie the black scholes modelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing which are used throughout the book in chapter 2 we discuss the analysis of spot energy prices as well as analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes that can be used to model the prices we look at the well know process of geometric brownian motion as well as mean reversion stochastic volatility and jump processes discussing each and showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated chapter 3 written by vince kaminski grant masson and ronnie chahal of enron corp discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets this chapter builds on the previous one it examines in detail the methods merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different pricing models introduced in chapter 2 examples from crude gas and electricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative aspects of calculating volatility chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets although such curves are well understood and straight forward in the most financial markets the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined curves in this chapter we describe forward price bounds for energy prices and the building of forward curves from market instruments we outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building forward curves in energy markets the arbitrage approach the econometric approach and deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic factors chapter 5 presents an overview of structures found in the energy derivative markets and discusses their uses examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps caps floors and collars as well as energy swaptions compound options asian options barrier options lookback options and ladder options chapter 6 investigates single and multi factor models of the energy spot price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives closed form solutions for forward prices forward volatilities and european option prices both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate model chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 simulation schemes are developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a variety of path dependent options in order to price options which incorporate early exercise opportunities a trinomial tree scheme is developed this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard european and american style options chapter 8 describes a methodology for valuing energy options based on modelling the whole of the market observed forward curve the approach results in a multi factor model that is able to realistically capture the evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves the user defined volatility structures can be of an extremely general form closed form solutions are developed for pricing standard european options and efficient monte carlo schemes are presented for pricing exotic options the chapter closes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the problem of managing the risk through time we begin with delta hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging illustrating the techniques using both spot and forward curve models the general model presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi factor hedging of a portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed chapter 10 examines the key risk management concept of value at risk var applied to portfolios containing energy derivative products after discussing the concept of the measure we look at how the key inputs volatilities covariances correlations etc can be estimated we then compare the fours major methodologies for computing var delta delta gamma historical simulation and monte carlo simulation applying each to the same portfolio of energy options in this chapter we also look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market variables finally in chapter 11 we review modelling approaches to credit risk we look in detail at two quite different approaches creditmetrics j p morgan 1997 and creditrisk credit suisse financial products 1997 for which detailed information is publicly available together these provide an extensive set of tools with which to measure credit risk we present numerical examples of applying these techniques to energy derivatives before we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this book are tools which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of how both the tool and the market works the techniques we describe are certainly not magic wands which can be waved at data and risk management problems to provide instant and perfect solutions to quote from the riskmetrics technical document no amount of sophisticated analytics will replace experience and professional judgement in managing risk however the right tools correctly used make the job a lot easier,0
thomas knudsen hi vince i met with thomas this morning i gave you his cv before though i don t know if you had time to read it he s extremely interested in moving to enron and accepts that our work is far less academic than his postdoc research although far broader than his investment banking quant experience he remains interested and emphasised he wants to stay close to the traders but wants to look at new markets and products i think we should seriously consider hiring him he is understandably reluctant to move to houston but there s no doubt that there is plenty of unnmet demand for derivatives pricing and thinking here in london would you be interested in my setting up a videoconference in the next couple of weeks so you have a chance to chat with him i m meeting with him again on tuesday at an academic quant finance seminar organised by lane at king s college i ve attached his cv for your reference all the best steve,0

of such systems are airports sea ports mines nuclear facilities and more as with all stocks news drives the short term price fresh news has made vnbl a hot buy news on vnbl malibu calif business wire june 16 2005 vinoble inc otcbb vnbl news a holding company seeking to identify long term growth opportunities in the areas of homeland security security information systems and other security services announced today that it plans to offer products and services that will assist in the automation of the identification and control of equipment assets tools and the related processes used in the oil gas and petrochemical industries although small wirelessly networked rfid sensors can monitor machines and equipment to detect possible problems before they become serious they can also deliver safety features within oil wells oil maybe trapped in different layers of rock along with gas and water detection of specific liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur such as a well filling with water as with other rf based technology applications rfid can also provide the safe transit of materials by only the authorized handler and limit the entry of personnel to specific locations ensuring personnel safety is essential should there be an emergency at a facility rfid tags would enable the customer to track and evaluate its employee s safety and or danger this application technology requires product and hardware that can operate in harsh and potentially hazardous conditions but gives valuable safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer rfid can also assist the customer s supply chain by tracking oil gas and chemical products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail level vinoble s viewpoint as previously stated is that these applications are more than just a valuable tool to the mining industry but as a protective measure of our country s natural resources and commodities against threat preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of u s industry and economy the company believes that such offering service and technology application in the oil gas and petrochemical industry will further position vinoble in a rapidly expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the increasing capital and global spending that the company will require for growth the company s goal is to also provide a much needed service at a cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can t afford to do without the safety of

asset swaps vs cds s forwarded by bryan seyfried lon ect on 30 03 2001 17 12 martin mcdermott 23 03 2001 18 47 to john sherriff lon ect ect bryan seyfried lon ect ect cc subject asset swaps vs cds s john i haven t had much time to put something together on this issue fundamentally both instruments represent the same credit risk i e same credit events and contingent payments both represent senior unsecured credit risk the differences in pricing therefore arise purely from supply and demand one would expect generally that the asset swap would be lower than the cds because of liquidity there are only so many bonds out there and so demand for asset swaps is limited i am attaching a one page note by jp morgan where they claim that one of the principal reasons for the cds to be more expensive is people hedging convertible bonds by combining 1 a call option on the equity and 2 a cds if the call is cheap they will be willing to pay more for the cds driving the price up i ll try to synthesize something more complete next week cheers martin,0

iso new england and pjm propose standard market design message sent from the pjm customer info mailing list at pjm customer info majordomo pjm com iso new england and pjm interconnection propose a standard market design for wholesale electricity markets march 29 2001 holyoke ma two of the country s leading wholesale electricity market administrators iso new england inc and pjm interconnection l l c together with alstom esca corporation a systems developer for electric utilities today announce their intent to formalize an agreement that will not only standardize their electricity markets but will lead they believe to the standardization of wholesale electricity markets across the country today iso new england delivered a letter to the chairman and commissioners of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc enclosing a report concerning its proposed comprehensive wholesale market program that combines salient features of the pjm market model with elements of its own existing wholesale market design the combination would create a standardized wholesale market structure called the standard market design for wholesale electricity markets standard market design iso new england alstom esca and pjm acting through its wholly owned subsidiary pjm technologies inc have agreed to proceed with the negotiation of an agreement where iso new england will purchase the existing pjm market design and certain software components from alstom esca and pjm the two isos and alstom esca will work together to create a standardized market design that includes solutions to reserve markets and a common solution to unit dispatch this new market standard should put into place the necessary market improvements more quickly and at a reduced cost than if we were to implement a customized market system for new england said william w berry chairman and acting ceo of iso new england now is the time to stop the experimentation ultimately we hope the standard market design will serve as the benchmark for wholesale electricity marketplaces across the country if not around the world pjm is very excited to further standardize a design for a competitive wholesale electricity market said phillip g harris chairman and ceo of pjm along with the progress in the implementation of the pjm west concept this initiative will provide an even broader standardized market design this approach should further expedite the elimination of trading barriers across different markets and promote ferc s goal of creating a seamless marketplace we intend to continue to work with the new york iso on issues of mutual importance stated mr berry this new market design together with our efforts to address the market seams and other coordination issues will eventually bring the three northeast iso markets closer together iso new england and the new york iso will continue to work together on these issues under a joint board resolution passed on january 16 2001 because of our geographic location new york is in the center of the northeast markets with iso new england pjm and imo each on one of our borders we support the continued elimination of barriers across northeast trading markets to develop a more seamless marketplace where everyone will benefit said william j museler president and ceo of the new york independent system operator the new york iso will continue to work with our neighboring markets to remove barriers to trading across the region and to move towards larger regional markets this proposed market design standard will be developed jointly with stakeholder input iso new england will propose the standard market design to the new england conference of public utility commissioners and the new england power pool in a series of meetings next week additional meetings will be conducted in the next few weeks the standard market design for new england will be subject to ferc approval standardization requires consistent and reliable technology to facilitate a market s efficiency a market that moderates price fluctuations and encourages investment based on an expected return is an efficient market and efficiency is the key to establishing market liquidity said alain steven ceo of alstom esca in the future this agreement will be viewed as a catalyst in establishing more robust electricity markets iso new england inc is the not for profit corporation responsible for the day to day reliable operation of new england s bulk generation and transmission systems with an installed capacity of almost 26 000 megawatts in addition to operating the bulk power grid iso new england is the administrator of the region s wholesale electricity marketplace and the open access transmission tariff on behalf of the new england power pool iso new england is

california update 4 27 01 the following report contains confidential and sensitive information please treat with discretion executive summary ferc price cap decision reflects bush political and economic objectives politically bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on davis from an economic perspective he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation davis finds four major flaws with ferc plan most notably its exclusion of out of state generators june lst kill clause for ferc order could coincide with new bush regional plan california facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade expected 20 billion power bill this summer economic crisis would force deeper administration involvement qf bid for advance payments from pg e likely to fail in bankruptcy court new generation delays probable because of state qf squabbling consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to socal bailout deal 1 ferc fallout the ferc decision is a holding move by the bush administration that looks like action but is not rather it allows the situation in california to continue to develop virtually unabated the political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where davis cannot escape shouldering the blame once they are politically inoculated the administration can begin to look at regional solutions moreover the administration has already made explicit and will certainly restate in the forthcoming cheney commission report its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation it is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the ferc order and that the only ferc commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan 2 something less than effective price caps from davis s point of view the ferc plan has four major flaws the order applies only to california not to the rest of the west non california generators are not required to sell at capped rates to california as the order is written it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling state officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a stage 2 emergency and does not require any collusion even when the price caps kick in they are based on the cost plus for the highest cost producer supplying power to california and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap the generators can also charge above the cap provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to ferc 3 proposal kill clause adds to the political dilemma for davis the ferc proposal includes a kill clause that says the caps will be withdrawn unless california s iso agrees by june lst to become part of the regional grid now under ferc control if davis doesn t sign on to the regional grid by june lst then he will have to live with june 2 nd headlines blaming him for letting the bush price caps plan collapse 4 growing fiscal risk in california sources speculate that california could therefore pay as much as 20 billion on power this summer this is more than the combined enterprise value of pg e and sce these sources believe that because of the severity of the situation the ferc and or the federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for power the consensus is that the state of california will run out of money in about 90 days one of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for long term power deals the bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to california the bush administration and the fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture the country s largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months 5 qfs to seek advance payment from pg e meanwhile on the bankruptcy front the qfs reportedly will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from pge s accounts since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for gas it appears very unlikely that the qfs request will be granted if the qfs do not receive advance payment it is likely that most of the 4 000 mw of gas fired qf capacity will remain offline 6 delays likely in new qf generation the qf deals made with the state for long term contracts are being continually renegotiated which is likely to mean that the new plants those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated 7 consumer groups ready to challenge constitutionality of sce bailout plan harvey rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis of the mou for the sce bailout plan the analysis was done by a utilities analyst rather than a lawyer though it appears to raise a number of good legal points for example one of the elements of the mou is a non bypassable charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid this is effectively a tax since there is no exchange of value for money which under the ca constitution cannot be used to directly benefit a private entity this makes the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds rather than revenue bonds according to the constitution the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private company for this and other reasons even if the republicans would vote for the sce bailout which remains unlikely the bailout probably would not stand a likely constitutional challenge 8 governor hurt by continued failure to disclose long term power contracts the issue of the governor s failure to disclose the details of the long term power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged creating an even further delay,0

fw energy leader consulting generation evaluator ege vince this is the gentleman that wants to meet with you on the 29 th original message from steve mitnick enron mailto imceanotes 22 steve 20 mitnick 22 20 3 csmitnick 40 earthlink 2 enet 3 e 40 enron enron com sent monday may 21 2001 9 13 am to crenshaw shirley cc vkamins enron com subject energy leader consulting generation evaluator ege shirley as requested herein is information regarding the meeting with vince kaminski the presentation on the ege tool s applications and the allegheny energy case study is timed to take an hour if the meeting is most conveniently scheduled for tuesday may 29 might i request it be set for late afternoon as my other appointments are the next day and as vince will recall i was co leader of the energy consulting business of phb hagler bailly and developer of the ramp up real time 75 check and electric strategy tools presently i am ceo of energy leader consulting elc background the u s power generation industry has become increasingly efficient in recent years rapidly growing new entrants seek profit maximization aggressively utilities who still control most power plants endeavor to adopt the entrants methods yet inefficiency among many utilities remains widespread utility inefficiency arises from adherence to decades old habits and in unit commitment and dispatch and planned maintenance scheduling many utilities notwithstanding the industry wide trend towards profit maximization cling to ingrained routines inefficiency can also arise from the diseconomies of small scale a utility may operate a relatively small system fewer than a dozen plants a small system lacks portfolio diversification and perspective in its focus on its regulated customers playing the wholesale market at the margin for a variety of reasons utilities are reluctant to cut back the starts of their generating units let alone shut down any even temporarily or seasonally economically inefficient units continue to be committed week after week and run in the half load range ege objectives ege identifies and assesses generating units of a utility with questionable commitment routines taking into account transmission and reliability factors the procedure points towards profit opportunities that may be exploited by another industry participant i an industry participant can use ege as a basis for a medium or long term wholesale power transaction with a utility or to price wholesale power more aggressively to take market share from the utility i e compel changes in unit commitment habits ii an industry participant can use ege to spot and quantify efficiencies that would come from a merger or acquisition iii a power plant developer can use ege to estimate the incremental value a new plant will enjoy when the target utility s unit commitment routines inevitably become rationalized specific ege concepts ege reduces and analyses the extraordinary but unwieldy continuous emission monitoring data base intelligently focusing on profit opportunities it produces indicative statistics such as a the frequency distribution of starts per week b the frequency distribution of starts by day 15 minute segment during the week c the frequency distribution of load level d the frequency distribution of hours of operation per start e average heat rate and approximate fully allocated cost in the half load range f average ramp rate from the half load range g the frequency distribution of unused connected capacity during the highest demand hours and h forced off maintenance outage rate where indicated indicative statistics are generally aggregated by month year in some cases by temperature range they can be by regional wholesale prices as well ege establishes if the target utility has changed unit commitment routines significantly in recent years ege is based upon uniquely timely actual hourly operating data ege is now updated for the 4 th quarter 2000 through december 31 2000 ege lst quarter 2000 through march 31 2001 will be available approximately june 15 2001 ege also compares and ranks generating units commitment and dispatch with that of similar units operated by the target utility as well as other regional generators some utilities operate a group of economically marginal units at the half load level for lengthy time periods without an apparent reliability basis splitting the limited economic demand for power among the units other ege supporting data i planned maintenance schedule where indicated j actual maximum generating capacity k actual minimum generating capacity actual maximums and minimums can differ significantly from government reported values l average heat rate in the full load range and m average heat rate in the three quarter load range with respect to a generating units average heat rate in the half load three quarter load and full load ranges it can be instructive to rank these relative to similar generating units within a region it can also be of interest to identify significant seasonal variations in average heat rates and maximum capacities and changes in recent years in these parameters the real world example of allegheny energy allegheny energy can serve as a case study to illustrate the application of ege in the 4 th quarter 2000 for instance one high cost generating unit was started virtually every weekday morning 52 times and committed for the whole day in all but two cases arguably there are power products that could substitute for this routine in part at least at a profit to the seller of the product and allegheny energy another high cost allegheny energy generating unit was started virtually every weekend during the autumn nine times and committed for most of the coming week at another plant two high cost units were operated too often in the expensive half load range some 550 hours and three quarter load range another 400 to 600 hours they were seldom called upon to run at higher levels again there are power products that that address these practices and might appeal to allegheny energy offering of energy leader consulting elc ege is a procedure not a software package or data base elc believes this format is more effective in arming clients with the information they need to act upon profit opportunities elc transfers its knowledge about the ege procedure and the supporting data methods in a straight forward four step process 1 enron would select one to three target utilities 2 elc would perform the ege procedure on the target utilities 3 employing this real world analysis as a pedagogic tool elc in a one day seminar with enron personnel would instruct how to perform the procedure in the future without the assistance of elc 4 optionally elc would provide ege supporting data quarterly to enron the basic ege supporting data set is national including all generating units under the continuous emission monitoring program virtually all fossil fuel units parameters that are incorporated and the data set format will be specified upon request custom modifications will be considered steven a mitnick chief executive officer energy leader consulting 4807 41 st street nw

to cancel mseb contract the enron power project crisis on thursday deepened with the board of dabhol power company authorising the management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board even while international lenders to the project asked enron to renegotiate power purchase agreement signed with the mseb the decision to authorise managing director neil mcgregor to issue notice of termination on the contract to sell 740 mw of power was taken after the board prevented mseb from voting on the ground that it was an interested party the decision was taken with six votes in favour and the single opposition vote was cast by idbi sources said according to reports financial institutions such as anz investment bank credit suisse first boston citibank abn amro and the state bank of india have on wednesday advised enron against terminating its ppa with mseb mseb chairman vinay bansal who with two other directors attended the meeting on wednesday representing maharashtra s 15 per cent stake in the near 3 billion project said the indian side told them that it would be unfortunate if enron broke the contract while bansal declined comment on the board decision the sources said the indian side had expressed its interest to holds talks on the issue rather than terminating the project and there were possibilities of a fresh power purchase agreement between the company and the state pti the economic times friday apr 27 2001 mseb pays rs 134 cr under protest to dpc despite the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head maharashtra state electricity board on thursday made a protest payment of rs 134 crore disputed amount towards march bill of rs 146 64 crore to dabhol we were ready with the payment on wednesday itself but dpc officials could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh a senior mseb official said we have disputed payment of rs 12 64 crore and it would be now taken up at the disputes resolution forum of which enron india managing director k wade cline and krishna rao are members mseb sources said last week dpc had dashed off a communication to the government and mseb that it would not accept protest payments anymore cline had said the energy major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums which mseb in fact owed dpc in full and that the company would also not recognise the purported protest or reservation mseb had paid a rs 113 5 crore february bill in protest last month on april 23 last both domestic and international lenders of dpc had met in london and held exhaustive discussions the multinational s move to issue a termination notice to mseb and state government pti business standard friday april 27 001 enron india md authorised to terminate ppa the board of the enron promoted dabhol power company dpc at its meeting in london on wednesday authorised the managing director of enron india to issue a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the maharashtra state electricity board and the state government the board has authorised wade cline to serve the termination notice however this does not mean that the termination notice will be served immediately it is only an enabling provision and will be used only if the situation arises 8 a state government source told business standard from london he said dpc was under pressure from its lenders the dpc spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue the hardening of the board s stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of dpc s lenders who had warned enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notice the lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not be served at this stage serving of the notice requires a nod from the lenders who have an exposure of about 2 billion in the project sources said given the lenders strong opposition to termination of the contract the enron board s enabling resolution did not have much significance beyond conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio the maharashtra chief minister had warned enron not to scuttle the process of crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice the state government is to nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the dabhol contract enron holds 65 per cent in dpc while us based ge and bechtel hold 10 per cent each the balance 15 per cent is held by mseb through a special purpose vehicle maharashtra power development corporation the mseb representatives were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested party the idbi representative protested against the board s decision the meeting was attended by state energy secretary vm lal the meeting was held against the backdrop of a dispute between mseb and dpc over payment of bills after mseb failed to pay rs 102 crore towards the december 2000 bill dpc invoked the state government s guarantee and then the union government s counter guarantee when payment of the rs 127 crore january bill became overdue dpc again invoked the state government s guarantee mseb retaliated on january 28 2001 by slapping a rs 401 crore penalty for non supply of electricity at adequate levels it demanded that dpc adjust the bills against this penalty this stand of mseb was explained to dpc at the board meeting a state government official said the centre also supported mseb s stand and refused to honour the counter guarantee the power company then invoked the political force majeure clause a process of conciliation and arbitration between the centre and dpc is currently on the financial express friday april 27 2001 foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to dpc sanjay jog raghu mohan global banks comfortable with enron pull out lenders to the dabhol power company dpc are a sharply divided lot international lenders in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones led by the the industrial develoment bank of india idbi are categorical that additional assistance to dpc s phase ii will be held in abeyance despite the completion of 92 per cent of the project work the stage is also set for a preliminary termination notice to be served by dpc to the maharashtra state electricity board mseb within the next four weeks this follows the authorisation given to enron india s managing director k wade cline and dpc president ceo neil mcgregor to serve the termination notice and transfer notices to mseb following wednesday s dpc board meeting in london the essence of the message from the international lenders following the london meeting with dpc board is emotions do not work contractual obligations and payments have to be met we are convinced that the mseb has failed to meet its obligations there is no point in enron continuing with the project and the company should get out of it the structuring of dpc s debt has created two classes of lenders in phase i international lenders are covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phase ii no lender is however all lenders have a parri passu charge making attachment of assets a messy affair sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders to phase ii of the project are worried that an awry dpc project will affect their interests more given that they have no security other than assets like a sovereign cover it was this desperation that made local lenders like idbi slash the interest rates a few months back to 16 5 per cent from 21 5 per cent 8 a leading foreign banker pointed out three points that were made clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were a there are contractual obligations b mseb was not punctual in its payments to dpc and c mseb adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore rebate charge on dpc for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power while local lenders led by idbi with mseb parroting the same were of the view that the current situation is a temporary one international lenders were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out this is despite the stance taken by idbi and mseb that authorisation for termination given to mr cline and mr mcgregor was not called for international bankers pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped in its present form the points of contention are a that phase i of dpc is backed by a sovereign guarantee b phase ii is not and c to the extent that phase ii is covered by assets cancellation of phase ii may see all assets even those under phase i getting attached therefore an examination on the segregation of assets under phase i and phase ii is now warranted pti adds in a significant move dpc board has empowered its management to sever power supply agreement with mseb a move that could inflict a financial liability of about rs 2840 crore on the centre a decision to authorise dpc president neil mcgregor to issue a termination notice to mseb for sale of power was taken by the board at its meeting on wednesday the indian express friday april 27 2001 enron dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the mseb the board of dabhol power company a subsidiary of houston based enron corp has decided to warn the maharashtra state electricity board mseb that it intends to pull the plug on its guhagar based project in a board meeting held in london on wednesday the board decided to authorise dpc president and ceo neil mcgregor and enron india s managing director k wade cline to serve a preliminary termination notice for sale of power to the mseb within the next four weeks the dabhol project has been mired in disputes since mseb began missing payments last year mseb owes dabhol power 48 million for power delivered in december and january the payment ran into a dispute after mseb slapped penalty notices of rs 401 crore on dpc for its failure to supply power within three hours of the demand being placed but mseb has paid 24 million for february and a payment of 31 million was made for march on thursday the 3 billion dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in india to date issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable dabhol to suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputes while a preliminary termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead to the abandonment of the project by enron analysts have described the decision as a procedural move consistent with dpc s negotiating strategy to recover overdue payments from the mseb after the company issues the preliminary termination notice step two would be an official termination notice and step three would be a notice that the company is surrendering control of the project if the project is terminated the government of india will have to take a hit of 300 million besides paying bills of rs 1 500 crore for the next one year to enron as penalty our centre s liability if dabhol power project is terminated would be one year s electricity bill and a termination fee of 300 million power secretary a k basu said contractually the centre will have to pay one year s electricity bill totalling at present prices about rs 1 400 1 500 crore and take over dpc s debt which stands at around 300 million if the project was terminated basu said in delhi dabhol power is in the process of completing the second phase of the 2 184 megawatt power plant project which is 95 per cent through while the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company to get out of the project indian lenders led by idbi are asking the company to reconsider its decision on its termination notice during the meeting in london mseb which holds a 15 per cent stake in the project had strongly opposed dpc s move to authorise cline and mcgregor to issue notices for termination mseb chairman vinay bansal and technical director prem paunikar both directors on the dpc board and the state principal secretary energy vm lal an invitee to the board raised the issue at the board meeting in london mseb claimed that dpc was needlessly threatening to issue various arbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of ppa in isolation in recent weeks dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with the mseb delivering a notice of political force majeure to maharashtra a step typically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war coup or a similar radical political event in this case dpc s move was viewed as a threat to stop providing electricity dpc has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power critics object to the company charging rs 7 1 a kilowatt hour for its power compared with around rs 1 5 a kilowatt hour charged by other suppliers the hindu friday april 27 2001 offer of renegotiation too late enron by mahesh vijapurkar mumbai april 26 the enron sponsored dabhol power company which last night authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its power purchase agreement ppa with the maharashtra state electricity board has decided to keep a stiff upper lip this in turn has stoked speculation that the switching off of power from its phase i plant was imminent while in reality a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the ppa as one source familiar with the ppa told the hindu it is not sudden death of the project and in all probability the dpc vexed with the developments including sharp and pointed observations by the godbole committee has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option this would only eventually come into effect it is not an overnight operation and a lot of legal work is involved apparently the dpc intends to do some arm twisting at the board of directors meeting in london which maharashtra was initially disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contentions on the project the dpc squarely told the mseb nominees on the board that the offer of renegotiation had come rather too late it also said it did not see any room for optimism about the outcome it did not however rule out the option of talks thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to authorise termination was a new weapon the maharashtra chief minister mr vilasrao deshmukh had hoped that dpc would not take any harsh step which would cause lot of damage to the interests of both the independent power producer and the government and today he expressed his dismay in fact the mandate of the team that went on the strength of its stake in the dpc was to put across the idea that negotiation was the requirement and not confrontation echo in ls the enron issue also echoed in the lok sabha today where the power minister mr suresh prabhu said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs 2 840 crores whose liability in the project agreement was limited the centre s liability in case of termination is one year s electricity bill and a termination fee of 300 million blow to fis the termination could prove to be a serious blow to the indian financial institutions fis which under the leadership of the idbi were trying to convince the other lenders of the project against the notice the exposure of indian fis in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee either of the centre or the state the times of india friday 27 april 2001 enron ready to pull out but lenders say wait the dabhol power company board which met on wednesday in london authorised the company management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board the company however may not pull out of the project yet considering its lenders who met on monday opposed such a move and favoured renegotiations sources present during both the meetings said that though foreign lenders supported enron on the termination issue domestic financial institutions led by the industrial development bank of india prevailed over the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move enron needs the lenders consent to file a pre termination notice for pulling out from the project the decision to empower dpc chief wade cline to issue a termination notice was taken with six votes in favour against a single idbi vote against such a move another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the financial institutions made it clear that further funding of phase ii of the project will depend on the government of india assuring payment mechanisms institutions are yet to disburse about 30 per cent of the sanctioned package which is crucial for completing the phase ii expansion project the board has given powers to wade cline to issue a pre termination notice but the meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the project but to initiate serious re negotiation proceedings said mseb chairman vinay bansal who attended the board meeting mseb presented their views to the board members and it was understood by enron which also included the rs 401 crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings we have also made it clear that the tariff structure of enron is quite high and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable bansal added they cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any plans in that direction said a top banker who was present during the lenders meet there is a general consensus that the project must be completed and the proposal to terminate the ppa should be kept in abeyance he added the global arrangers for the dpc include anz investment bank credit suisse first boston abn amro citibank and the state bank of india where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company officials however some bankers said the company can file a termination notice even if one lender with a minimum 5 per cent exposure on the project favours such proceedings meanwhile in a clear reversal of roles maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the ppa we will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that would be bad news for all of us including dpc deshmukh said deshmukh was echoing union power minister suresh prabhu s sentiments who said that the government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row he however added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments and dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the 2 9 billion project would be a blow to india s efforts to woo foreign investors the dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over non payment of dues amounting to rs 213 crore and interest towards the bills due for december 2000 and january 2001 meanwhile mseb officials said in mumbai that the march bills amounting to rs 134 crore was paid on thursday as protest payment despite the dispute over the amount when asked on the future course of action bansal said it was up to the dpc the hindu businessline friday april 27 2001 dpc board authorises md to issue ppa termination notice the board of directors of dabhol power company dpc has authorised the managing director mr neil mcgregor to issue the notice of intent to terminate its power purchase agreement ppa with the maharashtra state electricity board mseb at an appropriate time the decision was taken at a board meeting held in london yesterday while mseb which is an interested party was not allowed to vote it made a presentation clarifying its stand on the matter a senior state government official said the resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice was carried by six votes to one idbi voted against the decision the official said the serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to a six month suspension period according to clause 17 8 of the termination procedure of the ppa following the giving of a preliminary termination notice the parties shall consult for a period of six months or such longer period as they may agree as to what step shall be taken with a view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to all the circumstances idbi and state bank of india the principal indian lenders had earlier persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination notice for some more time at least one lender has to consent for the company to serve termination notice it is understood that overseas lenders are in favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent however domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the ppa is abandoned mid way according to institutional sources indian lenders are trying to get all the parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues the maharashtra and central governments too are in favour of a conciliation mr vilasrao deshmukh chief minister of maharashtra yesterday went on record that the state did not want the project terminated mr yashwant sinha union finance minister is also understood to be of the same opinion the dpc will now have to decide what is the appropriate time to serve the notice the official said mseb pays rs 134 crore meanwhile mseb has paid dpc rs 134 crore towards its march 2001 bill mseb officials confirmed that the bill was paid in protest today morning they dpc had billed us for an amount of rs 146 crore we do not agree with some of the items included a senior mseb official said the pioneer friday april 27 2001 enron testing maharashtra s nerves t n raghunatha dabhol power company dpc has begun to put fresh pressure on the maharashtra state electricity board mseb the maharashtra state government and the centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them if the dpc board of directors decision to authorise its managing director to serve a contract termination notice to the mseb is any indication the dpc board in its meeting in london on wednesday empowered the company management to sever its power supply agreement with mseb a move that could inflict a financial liability of rs 2 840 crore on the centre the decision to authorise the dpc management to issue a termination notice to mseb was taken by a vote of six to one after the maharasthra government representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of interested party when contacted the company s mumbai based spokesperson mr jimmy mogal declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the dpc board we have nothing to say on the reports emanating from london we will express our views after a few days he said however maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh on thursday termed the dpc board s decision as unfortunate we have already requested the company not to take any harsh decision mr deshmukh said in mumbai official sources in the state energy ministry interpreted the dpc board s decision as a pressure tactic employed by the enron subsidiary to force the mseb to clear the pending power bills without any further delay through its tough posture the dpc wants to make its position stronger before it can formally agree for re negotiations with the mseb the centre and the state government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the state electricity board the sources said that the dpc s reported decision to authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the mseb did not mean that the enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrapping of the power contract with the mseb if anything the dpc s reported decision is to mount additional pressure on the mseb for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger position in settling its dispute with the mseb as part of its plan to arm itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its control the dpc had recently served a political force majeure to the mseb the centre and the state government the sources said not surprisingly the dpc s london decision comes on the heels of the maharashtra government s decision to set up a high level committee comprising representatives of the mseb the centre and the state government to re negotiate with the enron s subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the state electricity board meanwhile amidst the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head the mseb on thursday made a protest payment of the rs 134 crore disputed amount towards march bill of rs 146 64 crore to dpc riday april 27 the telegraph friday april 27 2001 enron signal to switch off dabhol power enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversy ridden dabhol power company when it won an authorisation from the company s board to stop sale of power to maharashtra state electricity board mseb the meeting of the company of which the houston based energy giant holds 65 per cent and the mseb 15 per cent was attended by state energy secretary v m lal and mseb technical director p paunikar and it came days after its lenders discussed payment problems and a possible termination the centre s liability if enron decides to snap the agreement will be a year s power bill and a termination fee of 300 million however the company will have to wait for six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls the plug the centre shrugged off the move saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power if enron walks out we do not see fdi inflows into the power sector being hit 8 power minister suresh prabhu said mseb officials said the ball is now in the court of dpc which said its corporate policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board meetings the decision coincided with a rs 134 crore protest payment by the cash strapped power board as part of the march bill worth rs 146 64 crore there was speculation that mseb coughed up the amount to cool frayed tempers at enron s hub in houston and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head mseb officials brushed away the allusions saying the cheque was ready on wednesday but could not be handed over to dpc because of the state wide bandh we have a disputed payment of rs 12 64 crore which will be taken up at the dispute resolution forum 8 a board official said last week dpc told the state government and mseb it would no longer accept protest payments in a move to fortify its legal position mseb officials say bechtel and general electric the other partners who hold around 20 per cent in dpc are willing to go along with enron corp in terminating the deal but financial institutions such as idbi are not game because it puts their loans at risk investments made by indian institutions are not covered under the centre s and state s counter guarantees unlike those made by international lenders maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh called enron s decision unfortunate we had told state government officials attending the enron board meeting to stop the company from winding up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties 8 the statesman friday april 27 2001 enron threatens to pull out the enron crisis deepened with the board of directors of the dabhol power company deciding to authorise the managing director mr k wade cline to serve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the 2 9 billion power project the decision which could lead to the cessation of dabhol s power supply to the state was taken at the meeting held yesterday in london according to reports quoting the chairman of the maharashtra state electricity board mr vinay bansal while dpc officials refuse to comment on anything it is learnt that mseb was itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before the meeting mseb was said to have been dissuaded by the nationalist congress party president mr sharad pawar and union power minister mr suresh prabhu who had talks in new delhi with the maharashtra chief minister mr vilasrao deshmukh and an mseb delegation last monday the state government has been served two arbitration notices while the centre is ready to go for conciliation with the dpc for failing to honour its counter guarantee further the dpc has already slapped a notice of political force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of exigencies that force it to take an extreme step the union power minister mr suresh prabhu contended in delhi that since dpc contributed only 0 7 per cent of the total energy output of the country its termination would not have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation however if terminations proceedings go through enron corp a 65 per cent share holder in the dabhol power company would stand to net a hefty amount in damages the union power secretary has been quoted as saying that termination of the dpc would cost the centre rs 1 800 crore which is the total of one years electricity bill and a termination fee of 300 million according to an energy analyst mr pradyumna kaul the total liability would not cross rs 350 crore however mr prabhu said in the lok sabha today that the that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs 2 840 crore it is learnt that on 20 april mr deshmukh had given the go ahead to the mseb to prepare a legal notice to be issued to enron during the meeting of the dpc s board of directors on wednesday at the meeting the energy minister padamsinh patil energy secretary mr vinay mohan lal and mseb chairman mr vinay bansal were also present the notice was prepared over the past weekend and taken by the delegation when they called on mr prabhu on 24 april however the politicians convinced them that enron would not get tough given its huge stake in the project and that such a notice would not be necessary the meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff with enron s consent among those present at the london meeting were mr lal mr bansal and mseb technical director mr p paunikar in their capacity as directors however they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party the only vote to go against the decision was that of the idbi which is also represented on the board it is learnt the chief minister mr vilasrao deshmukh said the state was not in favour of terminating the project this could mean that the latest manoeuvre to arm twist the indian authorities could achieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over the past three months cleared the mseb owes enron rs 146 64 crore for march 2001 and rs 229 crore for december 2000 and january 2001 the centre today put up a brave face on enron s decision saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power sector in the country pti reported from new delhi there will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domestic or foreign company as far as we are concerned there will be no adverse impact on fdi in power sector 8 power minister suresh prabhu told reporters when asked about dpc s decision to authorise management to issue a termination notice to mseb emphasising that there would be no fallout of such decision prabhu said after the meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs we are expecting cooperation from many scandinavian countries as well as european nations in the power sector in fact not only the power minister but also the prime minister of norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on power and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector 8 mid day dpc may not wind up maharashtra chief secretary v ranganathan has said that though neil mcgregor managing director of the dabhol power corporation dpc has been given complete powers with regard to dpc s operations in the state including the authority to wind up operations it does not necessarily mean that mcgregor will issue such a termination notice mcgregor was given the powers at a meeting of the dpc board in london on wednesday ranganathan said that state officials including maharashtra state electricity board mseb chairman vinay bansal and power secretary v m lal have reported back to him about the meeting in london with regard to the state s failure to pay enron ranganathan said bills are prepared as per the power purchase agreement ppa and dpc owes some money to us our people informed enron officials about this in fact there was no reason to give powers to the md to slap a termination notice in the london meeting mseb and industrial development bank of india idbi representatives insisted that the dpc must pay rs 411 crore since it could not supply power whenever needed chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the decision of the board of the enron promoted dpc to give mcgregor powers to wind up operations deshmukh added we have already requested enron not to take any harsh decision deshmukh had earlier said we have directed state government officials attending the dpc board meeting to desist the energy company from winding up operations in the state as it would be harmful to both of us enron officials are keeping mum on the issue mcgregor said i am not going to give any comment mid day april 27 2001 enron offers no comment on renegotiation h s rao a crucial meeting of the board of directors of the dabhol power company dpc promoted by the us energy major enron was held here yesterday apparently to discuss fate of its 900 million power project in maharashtra but there was no official word on the indian and state governments decision to renegotiate the contract an enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting saying the issues discussed at the meeting were confidential we have not received any direct communication unless we get it and evaluate the details we have no comments to make the spokesman said when asked about the proposed decision on re negotiation of the project in which the maharashtra state electricity board mseb has 15 per cent stake asked whether the board had taken a decision on empowering dpc managing director neil mcgregor to wind up its operations in india the spokesman said he had nothing to say on them enron has reportedly authorised mcgregor to look at various options including selling the company s stake in dpc maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said in mumbai that the state government would pay up the undisputed dues to the company he said the maharashtra government is not in favour of terminating the 2184 mw project but wanted an amicable solution to the imbroglio mid day friday april 27 2001 committee to renegotiate enron deal a committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with the dabhol power company will be appointed by this evening chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said today addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted social reformer anna hazare at his official residence varsha deshmukh said the committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow at the most he termed as unfortunate the enron board decision empowering dpc chief neil mcgregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the maharashtra state electricity board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue with power company renegotiations will be held as per the suggestions made by the godbole committee and the center will also depute its representative on the renegotiating committee we don t want to take any hasty decision deshmukh saidhe pointed that the only bone of contention with the dpc had been its expensive tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicably when pointed that the enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despite state 9 s willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee chief minister said it was unfortunate earlier in his meeting with hazare deshmukh promised to make necessary amendments to the right to information law recently passed by the state so that the information was easily accessed by the common people he also gave a patient hearing to hazare on his complaints of corruption in various state departments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry within three months afternoon april 27 2001 enron s on state govt to renegotiate dabhol power project by hubert vaz the us power giant enron power corporation s willingness to wrap up the dabhol power project and leave the shores may not actually materialise though the dabhol power company chief mr wade cline has been authorised to do so since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the matter disclosing this chief minister vilasrao deshmukh confirmed this morning that the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the power project at dabhol could be continued and at the same time enron did not feel slighted enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision we are waiting for their letter he said when asked what sort of compromise the state government plans to forge mr deshmukh said let our officers come back after that we will decide a future course of action but we are definitely going in for renegotiation of the project it is very difficult to predict the outcome of enron s decision but as of now the project is still on when asked whether the project could be moved to another state if wound up from maharashtra mr deshmukh said that was not possible as per the terms of the agreement between the us company and the state government however it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself he indicated he also confirmed that both parties would face considerable losses if the project was terminated the board of directors of the dabhol power company which met in london on wednesday decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the project once and for all by empowering the dpc chief to terminate the project if he deemed it fit however this decision as of now does not necessarily indicate the death knell for the project the enron project which had been riddled with controversies right from its inception had been a pretext for the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time to time the previous sena bjp government which had been out to terminate the project however chose to continue with it following renegotiations with enron s top visiting officials like ms rebecca mark and the democratic front government inherited the controversial project when the governments changed hands a year and a half ago meanwhile state energy minister dr padamsinh patil when contacted at the osmanabad circuit house said the state government and the central government have decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project with enron it is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like that they will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for both sides he said in case the project is terminated the government can still manage the power needs of the state though it would be a bit tough job he added,0

new update on ppi model for inflation book final version dear all attached is anjam s reasoning and final version of the uk ppi pllu model the uk inflation book s main exposure is to two ppi indexes the pllu and the dzcv through year 2010 both are ppi output indexes with very comparable baskets the only significant difference between the two is the presence of energy in the pllu 7 6 the model in use escalates the two indexes by the same factors however with the energy price fluctuations in recent years different models for the two indexes would reflect better the nature of their drivers anjam concentrated on the pllu index first and he will shortly construct one for the dzcv based on the same methodology but without the brent crude curve the new model achieves the two main objectives of the ppi curve it is significantly more robust and stable than the existing one and it is considerably less sensitive to the input coefficients this will result in us having more confidence in our monthly p l as well as less fluctuations best regards martina x 34327 anjam ahmad 10 03 2000 11 59 to martina angelova lon ect ect cc subject new update on ppi model for inflation book dear all i followed up on the suggestions of happening babe at the conference call as follows 1 use less data unfortunately kicking out only 1990 makes the overall equation a lot less robust in fact dramatically so and so eliminates the possibility of using less data the model tested was the rpi month 15 ppi pre empts the moves in rpi by about 8 months the magnitude of the oscillations is also reduced this shows that if we had more detail in our rpi forward curve then the ppi model would reflect those peaks and humps adequately conclusion i therefore propose that we use the model that incorporates rpi rpi t 15 and deviations of brent crude from long term average the new model is plotted below in burgundy and can be compared to the old ppi which is depicted in blue please note that all this analysis only applies to pllu and that a separate study will be needed for the dzcv ppi index regards anjam x 35383 forwarded by anjam ahmad lon ect on 09 03 2000 16 52 anjam ahmad 08 03 2000 14 03 to martina angelova lon ect ect harry arora hou ect ect maureen raymond hou ect ect zimin lu hou ect ect farouk lalji hou ect ect cc trena mcfarland lon ect ect dale surbey lon ect ect stinson gibner hou ect ect vince j kaminski hou ect ect leandro ibasco corp enron enron subject update on ppi model for inflation book dear all we thought it might be useful to incorporate brent crude as an explanatory variable for ppi it was found that deviations of dated brent crude from the long term average of 18 80 was the best form of the variable to use for predictions the brent forward curve produced by the global products group is used the three new equations developed were pllu t a rpi t b rpi t n c datedbrentcrude 18 8 constant where n is 14 15 or 16 reddish curves r squared approx 0 49 f stat approx 32 the chart below shows what our projected pllu curve would be given this equation and also the three best relations from before which were based upon current and future rpi pllu t a rpi t b rpi t n constant where n is 14 15 or 16 greenish curves r squared approx 0 47 f stat approx 45 comparison of models as you can see the two equations differ in the very short term and very long term the inclusion of deviations of brent crude leads to short term predictions of 3 0 to 3 2 over the next six months the greenish curves predict pllu in the range of 2 5 to 2 8 over the next six months the curves are then very similar until 2009 when the models including crude break away to the upside relative to the falling rpi curve the model based purely on rpi hugs the rpi curve much more closely in the longer term this is only important to the extent that we have large positions beyond 2009 which we don t suggestion what could be useful now is a differently specified model designed to forecast only the next 3 months using auto regressive or auto regressive error terms this model would be far more accurate in the near term and we could include this information onto the front of this long term model this may be useful despite the fact that most of our exposure is in future time buckets back testing all the models give similar visual and statistical performance over the data sample used based mainly on 1990 s new paradigm economy hopefully we can discuss these and other points later in the tele conference your ideas on this would be appreciated regards anjam x 35383,0

changes in option valuation in enpower forwarded by zimin lu hou ect on 03 21 2001 08 33 am from harry arora enron enronxgate on 03 21 2001 07 26 am to sanjay gupta enron enronxgate steve nat enron enronxgate cc zimin lu hou ect ect subject changes in option valuation in enpower sanjay wanted to confirm the changes to the option valuations in the enpower we discussed yesterday evening 1 currently the trader volatility inputs are the daily vol curve and the intra monthly vol curve the monthly options get marked directly to the monthly curve plus the smile and the monthlies get marked to a time blend of monthly and intra month vol plus the skew we want to change the valuation for the eastern books so that the dailies get marked to the intramonth curve which we want to call the daily curve and the monthly gets marked to the monthly curved there will be not vol blending done by the enpower system for the daily and monthly option valuations we want to make this change very soon by early next week 2 currently there exists one smile for every region which is specified in terms of volatility additive for specified dollar difference from the underlying since different months in a region can trade in a large range 35 150 this cannot result in accurate skew for all terms what we need is a system which has skew per month we suggest for the short term the skew should apply only to the summer daily expiration options we need to make this change by early next week however we need to start modifing the system so that for every region we can enter a grid which has a percentage scale and specifies the skew differently for each month research has implemented this in our pricing model and we would like this grid to be input into the valuation system i am enclosing the pricing model which we both discussed yesterday for reference this model is however work under construction so pls call alex huang for clarifications 3 the vol input system is complex and confusing i would very much be interested in moving to a direct database interface which accomodates the skew inputs per region as in we should implement a ui which can input the dailies and monthlies at the moneys and the skew grid directly so that we do not need to go through multiple iterations i am very much interested in what we currently are releasing in delphi and would love an early implementation for options on all these issues i am speaking for the east desk i am going to touch base with west guys and see if they are on board with these changes thanks harry,0
re the consultant s model for gary hickerson s group the model is supposed to be a real option model to capture the value of power plants of gencos it is to give trader a better insight as to whether the market is overvaluing undervaluing certain genco stocks and trader can act accordingly i m still trying to find out how trader is supposed to use it modeling details the model takes in all gencos locational power forward prices and fuel forward prices and uses garch model to simulate one year daily prices and then uses a hourly profile to convert them into hourly prices garch model parameters are estimated by the consultant using and separate model and are updated twice a year and it does not matter whether the simulation starts in january or september using these prices it will determine whether a unit at a particular location will be dispatched or not depending on a spread of power and fuel prices and b whether the start up cost can be recovered during 8 operation hours the unit can be dispatched at minimum and peak levels fixed o m sox and nox i don t know what the last two stand for are taken into consideration with the simulated dispatch schedule the model calculates the value that can be generated by this unit then sums it up across all units the final value is the average of 100 simulations and it takes about 16 hours to run for about 200 units after our conversation the consultant promised to look into a how to make the model more flexible say to allow a different time horizon b reduce spreadsheet overhead by doing calculation one unit a time and not saving all the intermediate information as of now it saves everything on the spreadsheet assuming the garch process is modelled correctly i believe the methodology is ok though it does not capture most of the optionality my concerns are whether the price processes are modelled correctly i have to get more details before making any conclusion 100 simulations are way too few unless we convert the algorithm to c i don t see how spreadsheet can handle more simulations i guess that s why they contact us but again if enron s buying the model from the consulting company why should enron do their job for them how trader s going to use the model output for this i phoned jeff the associate who initiated all these and am still waiting for his returning call a related questions why the model horizon is one year we can either oversee the conversation but not doing actual coding for them or redo the model for them the problem still remains that how trader s going to use the output but in view of the great wall of china separating the business units should we do it as of now i have a simulation model taking start up cost fixed o m rump up delay into consideration it simulates monthly prices using gbm and takes 2 minutes 40 seconds to run 10 000 simulations for one unit for ten years 120 time steps it can use forward forward vol and incorporate seasonality into it i understand this is debatable one interesting observation is that when using forward forward vol simulation the standard deviation is about 0 5 while standard deviation using forward vol is about 2 also incorporating seasonality increases the value by about 1 6 since most of the time cost occurs in price simulation and we are to simulate about 20 price processes i hope the full model if we build it will take a couple of hours to run for 200 units the main task will be interfacing i e getting data from data base and outputting the results this is where i need most help if i am to do it please advice the course of action i

enron communications subject material for thu 2 mar wg meeting hello all appended below you ll find a summary of ideas that people have contributed since we at caida began to get the metrics wg started some of this material has already appeared on the metrics mailing list the older material comes from personal emails i m posting it again to give us all some more ideas to think about for those who are able to attend the wg meeting in san jose this thursday 2 mar i d like to spend time in the morning getting to know about attendees interests and experience in making internet measurements i suggest that a good way to do this would be to have each group give a short 10 minutes response times and this gets even more interesting you only need to be able to see traffic in one direction from client to server to get a fairly accurate round trip time from the client to the server irrespective of how far away the client is from your measurement host because of tcps three way handshake for connection establishment when you see the opening syn you wait for the client to ack the server s syn ack and you have the client server round trip time i think you ve actually already done some of this we could also potentially try to correlate dns queries and tcp connections perhaps determining some probabilities in a given environment of a host initiating a tcp connection to a host for which it just received an a record and track various application level response times i d personally love to have a lot of data on the ratio of dns response time to tcp transfer time for http connections even if the measurement makes no attempt to discern what constitutes a web transaction to the user a full page usually many tcp connections anyway i think there are some fairly interesting things we can measure with simple techniques these are just some simple ones there may be some interesting things we could do by digging into payloads of a few of the other highly utilized applications but doing it for tcp is a nightmare perfomance wise but we now have the basic infrastructure to do things with dns over udp we can probably cover any open udp protocol without incurring performance penalties that would make it completely unusable snmp for example while its application is limited network service providers would find round trip time information for snmp packets from their network management stations to agents very useful i think there are some rudimentary things we can do with tcp as well and i also think some sites would be interested in having some rudimentary information for example a weighted by traffic round trip time distribution for tcp traffic to from all networks with which you communicated say at 24 granularity this gives sites a notion of how close they are to those they talk to most frequently with a little more work we could probably make reasonable bandwidth estimates for every end network for which we see tcp data we could certainly get a reasonable number for the maximum observed bandwidth these methods also decouple the measurement from the traffic while we all know the value of that i think it s significant in that active probers can be run on the same host decoupled from the actual measurement and with timestamps coming from kernel space bpf i ve been thinking about this for a long time because eventually i d like skitter and other tools to be able to do use tcp packets for probing with no need for things like ip firewall code if i can just properly time non blocking connects and count on the passive tool to see the syn and syn ack i can use any tcp port for round trip time measurements and not trick my kernel by sending tcp packets on a raw socket i need feedback from the passive tool for tracing like skitter it needs to know when a reply has been seen from a hop and when the destination has been reached but it s not difficult simple bytestream oriented ipc is sufficient going further i like the idea proposed by some others maybe funded at this point i m not tracking it of instrumenting the freenix tcp ip stacks a lot of useful information could be pulled from the stack but eventually someone s going to have to come up with what pieces of information are desirable enough for someone to want their stack instrumented and it ll have to be somewhere between what s currently implemented and a full blown metering system like rtfm and i think in the interim there are a lot of things we could do using libpcap on our local machines non promiscuous and in user space safe easy to implement and test to me the benefits here are a user is likely to have a tangible well understood relationship with their workstation understood by them this is particularly true for those of us with network expertise so it s at least plausible that we can find correlations of measurements with user experience in a fairly short period of time helping us hone in on what s useful even if we only find weak correlations for whatever reason once a correlation exists more people will be interested in helping with development because it ll be something they ll use personally we re essentially guaranteed to see traffic in both directions i d personally be interested in trying to find some small sets of information that correlate to user experiences so that it doesn t take a terabyte of disk and 64 processors to deal with data from say 10 000 desktops anyway just some random thoughts the hard part for me at the moment is thinking about useful generalizations and infrastructure to support them cindy bickerstaff responded we re just starting to capture the mss and window size negotiations between timeit and servers to get an idea of what is typical or usual wonder if daniel s code could do that too from the various traffic monitoring points caida has out there the data could be used to fill in some parameters for trying to model some of the passive data collected since a typical web page has many elements between a single client and server the first or base page gives you a starting idea of what to expect and the subsequent elements are like repeat measurements of the same path over a very short time interval since there is a strong time of day week effect volumes and perf the short duration of the data collection from a single web page incl elements might give some options for modeling and maybe getting a better estimate of packet loss i ve really enjoyed joining the e 2 e interest group for the ideas on factors and the references to past modeling attempts e g mathis et al paper ack its bulk transfer focus paul krumviede highlighted the difficulty of agreeing on details of how to measure common metrics like availability reliability throughput and latency an example was throughput since it was proposed that this be measured using a tcp file transfer of random data one concern was what does this do to latency and where does this get measured as many customers of this service would not be large businesses measuring this from the customer end of a 56 or 64 kbps circuit was almost certain to drive end to end latency measurements beyond defined bounds measuring it from within points in the provider s network s might show figures that the customers could never see themselves the compromise was to define the throughput metric as ocurring at access link loads of no more than 50 of the bit rate but how does one measure that and so on given that this discussion was recognized as being the prelude to the imposition of minimal slas as part of the certification process for service providers this may be an illustration of the perils of discussing slas and metrics in some interchangable form but they may not be easy to separate in the minds of some carter bullard said i m specifically interested in bridging rtfm and ippm work particularly to describe how an rtfm can be a generic connectivity monitor ippm describes type p unidirection and bidirectional connectivity and a single point rtfm can detect these conditions but standard descriptions for how this can be done would be very useful personally one of the things that i m interested in is tcp based streaming services performance such as that seen in internet radio distribution and of course ip telephony wireline performance metrics would be very good to describe nevil brownlee comments that he s also very interested in developing the rtfm meter as a platform for more general measurements two areas seem interesting apart from getting more information from tcp streams qos difserv performance what metrics do we need to characterise this ipsec what metrics will still be useful when we can t look at port numbers what kinds of traffic can still be identified curtis villamizar said i m particularly interested in the work on dos at http www cs washington edu homes savage traceback html and would like to see that on the agenda this would provide a general way of determining where packets came from not just a tool for tracing dos attacks,0

re estimating tail of distribution and additional risk measures naveen the analytical var approach is working for equity portfolio it gives us the tool to examine the tails behavior for this portfolio and calculate expected tail loss the same should be done for commodities portfolio as well meanwhile as we discussed we can give some rough estimates of the losses corresponding to percentiles other than 5 th look at the figure below you can see var numbers for 5 1 0 5 and 0 1 calculated with 1 simulations 100 thousand simulations 2 analytical var gamma delta positions representation 1 and 2 are very close because there are not many options in equity portfolio 3 simulations 1000 simulations to calculate 5 var then in order to approximately estimate var for 1 0 5 and 0 1 i scaled 5 var with factors corresponding to normal distribution for example norminv 0 001 0 1 norminv 0 05 0 1 for 0 1 the result of such extrapolation in this case is quite good just 5 different from the correct number we probably can use such rough estimates of tail for commodities portfolio until we have proper methods implemented tanya tamarchenko 02 28 2001 01 17 pm to wenyao jia hou ect debbie r brackett hou ect ect cc vince j kaminski hou ect ect subject re analytical var implementation in risktrac debbie i am forwarding to you a 2 page document describing implementation of analytical var in risktrac here is why this effort is very important 1 we need to calculate var for other percentile but 5 1 or even 0 2 as mentioned by rick buy and our simulation model can not handle required number of simulations 2 we need to present additional risk measures such as mean tail loss to the board the analytical approach is implemented in a spreadsheet and fully tested already so there will be no problems with the algorithm itself we need to get together and discuss it implementation what do you think tanya,0

mark to market bob i wanted to continue the analysis on mark to market that i had spoken to you about on the phone i thought that it was getting very difficult explaining the whole transaction by phone so i am having krishnarao who is in vince s group explain the transaction to you krishna has been helping us structure the deal here in india and he has just returned to houston from india after working with the team here he will seek an appointment with you to explain the transaction i would like you to please spend some time with him and then based on the discussion please send us a note detailing how sucha a transaction would be marked to market please cosider the fact that currently there are no such transactions from the indian side this is a very important transaction for us and we may need to repeat this in coming months hence setting up the system to account for these maybe well worth it also what i am concerned about is that there will be an enron india eipl account in india based on indian gaap and upon consolidation there will be a us gaap accounting in the us it is here that we would like to have mark to market accounting eipl is structured through mauritius and then caymen islands another key question to consider is that when we m t m the transaction in the us there will be a tax accruing in the year of m t m say 2000 however in india as a result of the accrual accounting there will not be any income showing till the year 2002 or 2003 we will need to know how that would get treated and whether there is a way to get credit for the tax payable in the us i am also confused about whether us tax would be levied since none of the income is being brought back into the us remains overseas subpart f and other concerns finally we have been working hard in structuring a fixed price contract and getting a fixed for floating swap in the us this is still not allowed to indian corporates i need you to think about this too and see if some type of accounting will solve this issue krishna knows what i am talking about and will brief you on the same krishna please walk bob through the three structures we had worked here look forward to your help and comments this is going to be an exciting project for us all regards sandeep,0

alliance info alert ferc report on western markets at its special meeting today ferc released the results of its eagerly awaited probe into california s summer power crisis concluding that under certain circumstances california ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates due to california s seriously flawed market structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the west the ferc staff report on western markets and the causes of the summer 2000 price abormalities entitled part i of staff report on u s bulk power markets is available at the following website in response ferc issued an order proposing a series of sweeping structural changes to the california iso and px to help remedy the pricing problems and solicited public comment by november 22 a technical conference has also been scheduled for november 9 to discuss the proposed solutions and other remedies that might be suggested details tba while all four commissioners supported the order the order stretched the commission chairman hoecker and comm breathitt expressed strong endorsements while comms hebert and massey concurred citing areas where they felt the commission had either over reached or not gone far enough as discussed below a final order is expected to be issued by year s end at the same time the commission warned california consumers of their continued risk of paying higher prices unless policy makers there resolve state issues such as 1 immediately implementing the availability of day ahead markets for power purchases 2 development of demand responses 3 siting of generation and transmission and 4 assurance of sufficient reserve requirements highlights of proposed california structural remedy in its order ferc proposed a series of market overhauls including 1 eliminating the state s mandatory requirement that the state s investor owned utilities buy and sell electricity through the px and allowing these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks 2 requiring market participants to schedule 95 percent of their transactions in the day ahead market and instituting a penalty charge for under scheduling in excess of five percent of hourly load requirements in order to discourage over reliance on the real time spot market 3 establishing independent non stakeholder governing boards for the iso and px 4 modifying the current single price auction system by a imposing a temporary 150 mwh soft cap that prohibits supply bids in excess of 150 from setting the market clearing price for all bidders b requiring sellers bidding above 150 mwh to report their bids to ferc on a confidential weekly basis and provide certain cost support and c requiring the iso and px to report monthly information on such bids the commission s price mitigation measures would remain in effect through december 31 2002 5 declining to order retroactive refunds for the state s ratepayers and utilities citing insufficient authority to do so but subjecting sellers to potential refund liability for transactions from october 2 2000 until december 21 2002 but no lower than their marginal or opportunity costs if ferc finds non competitive behavior 6 encouraging accelerated state siting approval and introduction of demand response management programs separately the draft order rejected the iso s request for an extension of its current purchase price cap authority and the px s request for price capping authority commissioner responses comm herbert reluctantly concurred noting that his decision may change when a final order is considered based on comments filed or testimony offered at the november 9 meeting he stressed that he would have preferred that the order address four areas 1 eliminate all price controls in california markets 2 abolish the single price auction entirely 3 terminate the buy and sell mandate in the px and 4 direct the iso to address a long list of cited problems in its january 2001 rto filing rather than having the commission prescribe specific remedies hebert stated that while he was opposed in principle to the soft cap concept if one had to be adopted then the soft cap should increase incrementally increase over time at specific pre announced dates he believes that this would serve to both encourage greater investment in facilities and additional forward contracting as well as provide an incentive for california regulators to address market design and other flaws also he would not have disbanded the stakeholder governing boards at this time but allow the iso and px to address this issue in their january 2001 rto filings in addition he would not dictate risk management methods preferring instead that market participants determine appropriate actions on their own finally he advised californians not to be so environmentally focused that they do not realize their tremendous need for generation capacity comm breathitt stated her approval of the order while warning that ferc cannot allow the events of this past summer to reverse or slow the progress towards open and competitive markets she noted that it was the commission s job to guide the market to self correct and not to conduct command and control she also commended the managers of the iso and px saying that they have performed admirably however she noted she is awaiting comments on the single price auction remedy and its accompanying confidential reporting requirements comm massey concurred but emphasized that he advocates a more aggressive approach he feels that the congress has put its thumb on the scale in the federal power act to protect consumers stating that prices will continue to be unreasonable in the future he believes that this order moves in the right direction by proposing solutions to identified problems such as an over reliance on the spot market lack of demand response the need to reconstitute governance of the iso and px and the elimination of the buy sell mandate comm massey specifically called for comments regarding whether the 150 mwh soft cap went far enough whether ferc has the legal authority to issue refunds and to determine whether there should be a requirement for a certain percentage of forward contracting to hedge against the spot market price volatility finally chairman hoecker stated his strong support of the order but noted that this is no time to pull punches he emphasized that the commission needed frank comments from the industry he echoed comm breathitt s warning that competition is at risk and that they needed to get the markets back on track noting that the commission lacked authority to order refunds he stated that the responsibility rests with congress addressing jurisdictional issues he stated that siting problems encountered at the state level are slowing the meandering transition to competition he feels that the state of california and ferc need to work together to resolve these problems and that ferc is not attempting to usurp power rather california is part of a broader interstate market and is dependent on the western region for reliable energy thus placing the burden on federal action to make things work hoecker maintained the chairman also said that the commission will fully investigate and act upon complaints of market power abuse or further evidence provided by staff s ongoing investigation if you have any questions or comments please call jack cashin at 202 508 5499,0

option pricing discrepancy for j c penny transaction amitava and seksan have identified the source of the discrepancy between the option prices calculated by the credit reserve model and the stand alone spreadsheet model used in deal pricing the discrepancy can be traced to differences in input variables of the two models and not to any algorithmic differences the options being priced are a strip of options on monthly instruments the credit reserve simulation program calculates the time to expiration by assuming that the option expires on first day of the contract month of the underlying contract which is a very reasonable assumption the stand alone option pricing spreadsheet allows specification of the option expiration date independent of the contract month of the underlying in the jc penney transaction the monthly options were assumed to expire in the middle of the contract month when in reality the underlying monthly contracts expire before the start of their respective contract months the stand alone spreadsheet model allows such specifications and it is up to the user to ascertain that the expiration dates entered are legal at present seksan is ascertaining that the option contracts involved are in deed monthly options and not a strip of daily options in which case we would require estimates of intramonth volatilities for both the spreadsheet model and the credit reserve model regards rabi de,0

dispatch within maharashtra jim please find attached some slides that show the results of the henwood run giving dispatch for the dabhol plant within maharashtra i have also sent the presentation we made to you to wade he is to get back on when would be an appropriate time for him to go over the presentation with me vince stinson and i have placed ourselves on rebecca s calender for friday and we will make the complete pitch to her it would be great if you too could be present at the meeting if it is possible please do let me know on the attached slides please note that the slides all assume that there is a 1 part power tariff mseb liability for the entire capacity payment is not considered the henwood model was with no power flowing out of maharashtra when variable o m costs fixed o though in some months jan it goes as high as 69 mm hence overall mseb can pay for the dispatches as shown in the henwood run provided they are not paying for the capacity payment for the whole 2184 mw plant in conclusion therefore mseb has the need for between 1200 to 410 mw on a seasonal basis this means that the power remaining to be sold to other states is the difference between that and 2184 mw however since the demand within maharashtra varies seasonally it may mean that we need to market seasonal products to other states not long term blocks these are our conclusions we may continue to work some more on the fuel and hedging side if you have any more questions for me please let me know else for now there will not be any new henwood runs regards sandeep,0

re working gas price model vince i have a simplified version of brad s model in mind the no arbitrage condition equates trading margins across the country costs of transmission rise with congestion on the network wellhead supply is almost completely price elastic while burner tip demand is almost completely price inelastic storage is rationalized as a perpetual call option the least time variant parameters are the costs of injecting and withdrawing gas from storage to the pipeline followed by the costs of delivering gas from the wellhead to the pipeline the intermediate variant parameters are the capacity dependent costs paid to the pipeline above shrinkage for transmission the most time variant parameters are the trading margins and the valuations of the storage option there are 8 parameters to be estimated at each major node of the betwork they are identifiable in either of two straightforward ways using a short time series of the last 3 days prices based on the assumed variability mentioned above or point estimates calibrations using only today s data based on a node based model of competition between pipelines where pipes with the same region of origination albeit markedly different terminus price versus capacity similarly competing for outflows i will write this up for you in scientific word and present it to you at your earliest convenience clayton,0

alex tartakovski as you may know we are trying to schedule an interview for alex tartakovski in houston this week i am copying everyone involved because i wont be able to coordinate this tomorrow we just brought our new daughter home today and my wife is yelling at me to get out of my office i just found out that thursday friday are bad days for him so wednesday is the only day to do it this week he would come down tuesday night and fly out wednesday evening it s probably easiest for him to arrange his flight but he will need a hotel and transportation from the airport i gave him donna s phone number for help i assume the hyatt would be best his home number is 215 702 3705 and during the day his cellular is 267 981 5425 by way of background i plan to bring in 3 people from outside the company to fill in some of the vacants in my group s org chart the 3 areas of specialization that are needed to execute the business plan are 1 coordination of origination 2 deal pricing and underwriting and 3 modeling and portfolio management alex is the perfect person for 3 he has the deepest knowledge of probability of anyone i know and is efficient at building analysis models which will be a big job in this business because portfolio management needs to be redefined in real time due to the lumpiness of insurance contracts and the lack of any historical methods for evaluating these risks development of pricing models will be a joint effort between my group and the research dept because this will need to draw on the expertise in research as well as being a realtime activity as new deals are being structured i want to encourage joint work between vasant amitava and alex because his background and expertise is compatible with research over the past 2 years alex and i spent a lot of time developing new electricity spot pricing methodology and this is one area where he excels i would expect that he would be a valuable resource in research as well and so i would like for him to be able to meet with vince is possible this could possibly be done when vince is in philadelphia next week if there is time depending on what work needs to be done in the future i could see him working both on pricing research and this specific business unit i have attached alex s resume i assume he would be manager level but i m not sure of this this doesnt necessarily come across in the resume but the skills that are useful to us are probability statistical model development development of theoretical pricing methodology excellent computer programming skills database development and data analysis he has the best understanding of the nerc reliability data format outside of mike curley the nerc data manager designed and wrote the code for the pricing model used by ace power products for deal pricing and porfolio mgmt excellent understanding of options pricing methodology and its application to hedging insurance portfolios if you want to get into superconductor trading he can design the standards can beat me at atari battlezone as well as being able to navigate a real tank through a minefield one objective of this meeting in houston is to make him feel comfortable with the organization with which you did such a good job for me and to give him confidence that he will be able to do state of the art pricing research in the most innovative company in the world he is also interviewing for a job in morgan stanley s equity dept we will also arrange a meeting with per in ny but i would like to be in the office for that so we can do that next week please call me 610 996 2522 if there are any questions i may not pick up but i will reply to voicemail promptly i m up 24 hours this week anyway thanks dave,0

re status clayton we can discuss your request when i come back to the office on monday regarding the trip to portland such a trip requires an explicit prior permission from your boss myself in his absence or stinson in my and vasant s absence in case you did not ask for such a permission before the request is denied vince clayton vernon enron 07 20 2000 03 12 pm to vasant shanbhogue hou ect ect cc vince j kaminski hou ect ect subject status vasant i hope you had a wonderful vacation back home and are rested and recovered from the long flight back i wanted to give you an update of the eol project the gas model and of my intentions here at enron software in compiled c on the unix platform has been developed and debugged to listen to the eol trades process them book them and file them away in addition software has been developed and debugged to mark these to market on a continual basis and to store the entirety of open positions on eol in a dynamic matrix facilitating analysis it has yet to get back with me on how the software can be informed of those trades ultimately rejected for credit purposes these data files are stored in a format for reading by excel or by sas for which i have written the data step program and basic tabulation routines elucidating the structure of the data i am in the process of documenting all of this for you with regards the gas model and its slow performance on the compaq dell has agreed to loan me one of their competing machines to the compaq to see if the performance issue of the lp is related to the compaq i have been researching this issue with it here and with compaq and dell the new machine will be here any day now no financial obligation to anyone and i will be able to immediately ascertain whether the problem the model is having is compaq specific i am also in the process of documenting the gas model for you i ve tried to do my best for you vasant but i have been frustrated by not only the death of my mother but some internal systems in it here just the other day sas could not open a full query of the eol database because there wasn t enough free space on the server s hard drive for the workfiles in discussing some of these issues with some good friends of mine in power trading people whom i have known for over 10 years they indicated they were ubiquitous here the power traders have similar pc s to my new one and they have complained from day 1 that theirs are slower than their old ones also there remains a large frustration with the development of data warehouses during my brief tenure here it has gone through two differing proposals as to how to address this when i have been told of tools available for real time data harvesting my requests for such have typically been met with well we have it but we haven t really tested it yet an example is the weather we still do not record to disk the hourly nws observations from the goes satellite my interests here are to help enron to do well because i will do well only if enron does well these aren t empty words my ira is 100 invested in the enron stock fund i believe my best contributions to enron will be in the areas of systems as well as modeling and the difficulty working in the research group in terms of systems development is that frankly few people at enron seem to care what a researcher thinks about our systems we aren t directly generating revenues for enron and we aren t really their customers except in our relatively small deparrtmental infrastructure expenses as it happens power trading posted an opening for a modeling and forecasting person and i spoke with them and they asked me to take the job reporting to george hopley it is a wonderful opportunity for me vasant as they are interested in large system modelng of power grids as well as improving their traders access to real time fundamentals data i was completely candid with kevin presto regarding my shortcomings here in research i told him you were disgusted with me because i repeatedly failed to meet time deadlines they also understand i have yet to be at enron for 1 year and thus may only bid on a job with your permission we agree the move is good for enron we all work for enron and your acquiescence to the move does not endorse it but merely permit it they are comfortable with me they have known me for years as a hard worker honest and unpretensive they have already ordered a state of the art unix workstation and server for me and they have told me they will commit whatever resources are necessary for me to be successful including hiring an analyst to work for me and i have already been able to teach their analysts improved techniques for data harvesting and analysis i have learned here so i am requesting your permission to bid for this job opening it would be a lateral move in position and salary and i would commit to you to help you in any way possible in the future with regards the gas model or the eol database i will continue to work on their improvement and complete their documentation as it happens i am away on enron business in portland monday and tuesday and will be back wednesday i had wanted to talk face to face instead of by email but enron business supercedes i am on a team designing the data warehouse for floor trader support clayton,0

cc vince j kaminski hou ect ect wade subject re mark to market document link wade cline sandeep i met with bob today and discussed the deal structure we put together on the mark to market issue bob and his colleague wess told me that as long as payments are tied to one particular plant we cannot m t m them they had same problem with plants here in the us like the peaking plants and they had to separate the plant from power sales to be able to m t m the assocated cashflows what they did is they sold power from the plant to an outside party and bought it back from them at completely different multiple locations the buyback is not tied to any specific plant and is marked to maket even if enron can somehow mark to market a deal with dpc it can do so for only 50 of the cashflows because only 50 of dpc is owned by outsiders and a simple loan to an affiliate cannot also be marked to market bob was suggesting that if eipl buys options from dpc and from some other plants and in turn sells power to ap or karnataka then we could have a case for m t m politically dpc selling power to eipl may not be the best solution to put it rather mildly our alternatives as i see them are 1 do the deal as we structured it the only difference is that enron doesn t mark it to market and income is earned only in 2002 03 2 do the deal as we structured it eipl enron then sells the contract to another party at a profit the problem of course is finding this party and forking part of the profit to them 3 same deal except revenue securitization is done through an outside party in india not eipl bob said he will think about the issues some more this week let me know when you will be here next week so we can meet with bob together i will be going to boston for tuesday and or wednesday feb 1 2 i can book an appt with bob for us sandeep kohli enron development 01 23 2000 09 45 pm to robert butts pinnamaneni krishnarao ect cc vince kaminski wade cline enron development enron development ananda mukerji jaiprakash desai enron development enron development subject mark to market bob i wanted to continue the analysis on mark to market that i had spoken to you about on the phone i thought that it was getting very difficult explaining the whole transaction by phone so i am having krishnarao who is in vince s group explain the transaction to you krishna has been helping us structure the deal here in india and he has just returned to houston from india after working with the team here he will seek an appointment with you to explain the transaction i would like you to please spend some time with him and then based on the discussion please send us a note detailing how sucha a transaction would be marked to market please cosider the fact that currently there are no such transactions from the indian side this is a very important transaction for us and we may need to repeat this in coming months hence setting up the system to account for these maybe well worth it also what i am concerned about is that there will be an enron india eipl account in india based on indian gaap and upon consolidation there will be a us gaap accounting in the us it is here that we would like to have mark to market accounting eipl is structured through mauritius and then caymen islands another key question to consider is that when we m t m the transaction in the us there will be a tax accruing in the year of m t m say 2000 however in india as a result of the accrual accounting there will not be any income showing till the year 2002 or 2003 we will need to know how that would get treated and whether there is a way to get credit for the tax payable in the us i am also confused about whether us tax would be levied since none of the income is being brought back into the us remains overseas subpart f and other concerns finally we have been working hard in structuring a fixed price contract and getting a fixed for floating swap in the us this is still not allowed to indian corporates i need you to think about this too and see if some type of accounting will solve this issue krishna knows what i am talking about and will brief you on the same krishna please walk bob through the three structures we had worked here look forward to your help and comments this is going to be an exciting project for us all regards sandeep,0

re comments fyi forwarded by rakesh bharati na enron on 03 27 2001 07 43 pm sheridan titman on 03 27 2001 06 46 31 pm to rakesh bharati enron com cc subject re comments rakesh thanks for your input they are quite useful for helping me clarify my own thinking the following are my responses to your comments and clarifications the ed paragraphs are from me and the others are from you 1 the money is being set aside to avoid negative values it is not clear if you mean the values of the cash flow or the pv at the node anyhow we shall be setting aside money not just for that specific node but all nodes at that cross section of time as the risk free asset pays in all states of nature this will have to be done every time there is a negative realization thus for the typical project we have the value of risk capital may be extremely high as we are not following a tail based norm anymore i agree that this is confusing and needs further refinement i do this because i have some concerns about discounting negative cash flows this is discussed in my first memo this clearly provides a conservative estimate of firm value and a measure of risk capital that is too high from the perspective of evaluating the appropriate level of risk capital it is sufficient that enough capital be employed so that the pv at each node is positive also one might want to set the level so that the pv is positive in say 98 of all nodes 2 your memo appears to suggest that debt capacity is contingent on all values being positive if so we are only issuing risk free debt also a project with a single negative value at each cross section of time will not have a positive debt capacity again this is a very conservative initial estimate when the model is refined you probably want to define debt capacity so that the project defaults a certain percent of the time 3 it seems that our optimization argument is the discount rate which is obtained in each step from the comparison investment by equating the variances it is not clear if changing the discount rate will have such an effect on the project variance so as to lead to a global convergence i am not assuming that the change in the discount rate has a major effect on volatility in fact i think the process requires only one iteration when the volatility is independent of the discount rate again the idea is that we calculate the volatility of the project s value calculated with an initial discount rate using the calculated volatility and the stock of a comparison firm calculate a more appropriate discount rate if the volatility of the project s value is not affected by the change in discount rates then we are done if however the change in discount rates changes volatility then we may have to iterate let me know if this makes sense also our project has a finite life and the market based assets will have infinite lives in the light of this fact how will we define the relevant variance is it the spot variance of the returns of the comparison investment this is a good point i was thinking in terms of the average variance but this may not be correct actually we know that this is just an approximation and we need to think about whether or not it is a good approximation typically firms tend to ignore issues relating to the duration of their project cash flows when they determine discount rate which clearly does not make sense this requires some additional thought 4 finally our criterion is to subtract from the average pv the investment and also the risk capital setting risk capital to zero this model closely resembles the intuitive present value criterion and endogenously determines the discount rate this is correct my goal was to come up with something that was closely related to what you are already doing but which gives you some insight into how to define risk capital and the appropriate discount rate there are a number of ways that we can refine and improve this procedure what we need to first consider is whether or not the basic approach makes sense for the kind of projects that you are evaluating gas field case to facilitate your thinking we are providing a gas field example below we invest x million dollars to buy and develop a gas field a profile of expected production and variance of the production per year is available from the engineers at the beginning production will be autocorrelated as the profile will shift up or down based on the actual gas reserves being more or less than the estimated reserves we assume the life of the field to be 10 years with no salvage value there are fixed and variable operating costs it might be useful for you to think about applying the framework to this problem this problem is probably pretty straightforward because it is unlikely that the cash flows will be negative once the gas field is producing hence there is no need to be concerned about risk capital other than the x million dollars to buy and develop the property to value the property assuming all equity financing we calculate the value process of the developed project and compare its volatility to a comparison investment whose value process is observable e g a traded mlp the risk adjusted return of the comparison investment would then be used to discount the cash flows of the gas field please note that this procedure requires relatively strong assumptions and calculating the risk adjusted return on the comparison investment is not necessarily straightforward let me know when you would like to discuss this on another topic is it possible for you to give me information about one case where enron bought or sold a base load power plant where the purchaser financed the transaction with non recourse debt we would like the following information 1 the value of the power plant or purchase price 2 the amount of debt financing and the terms of the debt contract 3 some information about the pricing of gas power swaps and options about a year ago i gave vince a paper which develops a pricing model for project debt i don t think he thought that it could be implemented on the type of projects that enron finances however

dr kaminski you probably won t remember my name but i am the ph d student that took you back to the airport after your visit to louisiana state university during the previous academic year i received my m s in finance in may of last year and chose to remain at lsu to work on my ph d at that time i intended to pursue a career in teaching and research at a four year college or university in part because of your visit and my primary interest in normative research my plans have changed while i still want to earn my ph d i plan to pursue a career in research in the private sector as you know ph d programs in financial economics are designed to train future academics not surprisingly they emphasize methods to approach the types of questions that are of interest to finance academics what did surprise me however was that these areas of interest often had little to do with what i imagined to be the concerns of practitioners in the real world as you mentioned in your discussion academic researchers know little about what their counterparts in the private sector in light of my objective i feel i would get the most out of the remainder of my doctoral studies if i took some time off to work in the private sector to see first hand the types of challenges i can expect to face as a researcher in corporate america as my primary interests revolve around the use of derivatives and financial engineering in corporate risk management enron as the leading innovator in these areas would be an ideal place to learn i was wondering if you were aware of any openings at the company that might provide me with the exposure i am looking for if there are no such positions or opportunities any advice or suggestions you could give me such as whether or not you think such a sabbatical for lack of a better term would be helpful or information on private sector careers for ph d s would be greatly appreciated i am sending a current copy of my vita as an attachment if you have any questions my e mail address is sgreen finance lsu edu thanks for your help and advice cordially shane green vita doc,0

market development from the origination and trading perspective there are several people in various groups that are talking about storage but here is what s my take on our involvement please correct me or suggest otherwise shalesh ganjoo is our lead analyst on this effort in addition to his effort with your group he is presently supporting jean mrha with pricing and standardization for a traded storage maret stinson gibner is directly supervising him in this effort shalesh came to us through referal from david cox david discovered him at one of his speaking engagements shalesh had talked to david about traded storage market development some time last october and david refered shalesh to enron research group we hired shalesh for general analyst position and now he is pulled into all aspect of this storage effort currently he is our point person with stinson or i supervising his effort who is supporting jean mrha and you on the subject kara knop has aproached shalesh with request for some support and shalesh and she are sorting out each other s role in this regard as per my discussion today with david we need to coordinate this storage effort from the perspective of modeling market assessment etc for this i suggest shalesh and his effort so that all parties involved can benefit from collective effort within one central source based on david s and my assessment of shalesh s capabilities i would like to suggest that the commercial heads use shalesh for his creative thinking understanding of the market and analytical capabilities and not just for data gathering and simple research effort we can add other staff as we see the need and as you request them please respond this e mail with your comments if this sounds like aplan so that we can support this effort

re interview steve i submitted my evaluation general impression was rather negative he seems to be a consultant type person who speaks about everything with confidence but is short on depth and technical details he is personable outspoken organized on the positive side also the red flag is that he jumps from job to job typical after 18 24 months when any organization can ascertain his usefulness vince from stephen stock enron enronxgate on 04 17 2001 01 03 pm to vince j kaminski hou ect ect cc subject interview hi vince what did you think of david hsu my thoughts overall a good guy personable intelligent he could communicate reasonably well but seemed to be capable of losing objectivity in favour of technical advancement he didn t seem comfortable with taking a man management role at least he didn t want to be an administrator he appeared to know a lot about risk in fact jay web called me to say he felt david was one of the better risk guys he had seen but also commented that he needed to be coupled with a project manager to be successfull regards steve,0

re compound model for reedy creek stinson i think the gamma will flow into v r vince stinson gibner 11 30 2000 06 14 pm to alex huang corp enron enron cc vince j kaminski hou ect ect vasant shanbhogue hou ect ect subject compound model for reedy creek alex paulo and i have continued to look at the model and have come up with a couple of additional changes 1 the cash flow calculations need to include the overlying option strike payment also paulo is trying to clarify if the cashflows should be discounted to the valuation date or reported as notional future values 2 i would suggest trying changing the option valuation from a binomial tree approach to a one dimensional integration perhaps using a quadrature method this may allow us to minimize the size of the delta discontinuities 3 edith is supposed to check and see if the theoretical gamma is used for anything if it is we will probably need to revisit the gamma calculation since we are not currently including any cross terms for gamma thanks stinson,0

re progress steve thanks a lot i think that having the pseudo code will go a long way towards understanding how the system works and making sure that there are no bugs in translation of a business problem for example complicated credit insurance deals with multiple triggers and conditionality into the code regarding tanya s attitude just a few points 1 i don t think she has the skills to do the system administrator s work and she does not have the necessary privileges this explains why she keeps asking winston for help it s not that the work is beneath her 2 some members of tanya s team came to me complaining about winston he effectively told them to go away and work on the research projects and that he would take care of the it issues i don t think that it s just tanya s issue though i agree that a more outgoing personality would be helpful 3 the reality of this situation is that the internal customers beat on tanya and me whenever there is any performance problems and or they intuitively disagree with the results of a run they could not care less about the demarcation line between it and research they also want tanya to sign off on the model and she cannot do it without full access to the code the bottom line is that we are in full agreement tanya and winston have to work as a team and i shall work on my end to make sure that it happens credit is emerging as a critical issue for enron for the next few weeks and the system cannot fail vince from stephen stock enron enronxgate on 01 11 2001 08 23 am to vince j kaminski hou ect ect cc subject progress vince i got feedback from the lunchtime research meeting that you were talking about some specific solutions to performance of it systems in particular distributed processing also i heard that you had concerns about the use of multiple languages etc both of these sound like what i was discussing with you on previous occasions do you feel the need to discuss these further the multi language issue isn t really that much of an issue as the current system is 98 java right now although i am a big fan of c c it is my main development skill i am also very aware that java is a much more evolved and robust language i had serious doubts about the performance but i ve had a review conducted and the results are showing the sun unix implementation to be nearly as fast and in some cases faster than c c because of something they call hot spot technology its an instruction caching technique i believe the concerns i expressed to you were really about how technical people justify the use of a language on the strength of a relatively meaningless metric like portability on the issue of distributed processing the original review i had conducted by our architecture group pointed to that as a solution and as zhiyong wei is already working on global valuation project winston is actively working with zhiyong to see if he can model the var architecture on that and also to find a common valuation piece between the systems i d like the opportunity to talk to you about these issues if you have some time over the next few days also i sat in on the tanya winston meeting yesterday and as per our discussion at the elevator i attempted to help her argument by suggesting to all present that she was trying to perform triage on the code i e seperating research domain problems from it problems she said that stepping through code was the only real way in which she could get a feel for where performance bottlenecks were i asked her how she would measure that and she said she would instrument the code manually by inserting timing elements at strategic points i mentioned that a profiling tool could probably do this job for her tanya again said that stepping through code is the only way she can get an idea of the code and that studying documentation wasn t enough about 6 weeks ago i commissioned a team to document the system down to psuedo code level and will be able to provide this to you and your team soon in fact i ve asked for a draft copy to be given to tanya right now and winston is also working on a draft research it working together document which will identify how the exchange of information takes place tanya also gave the impression that she wants a dedicated it developer to do all the environment setup for her because she doesn t really want to have to do that i think that this is probably the root cause of the issue the it guys are working very hard and her handling of the situation is not good as it gives the impression that this kind of work is beneath her she is claiming that they are un cooperative they are claiming that she continually asks the same questions about set up over and over again and doesn t seem to want to learn how to do it winston on the other hand could be more proactive in determining what is a business related model issue and an it issue and ask for help from research i think you debbie and i need to work quite hard to get them to play nicely i have asked tanya and winston to go ahead and work very closely together over the next few days and debbie brackett and i will review their progress on friday in the meantime l ll be looking at setting up a working test environment that doesn t involve my main quant guys in day to to day setup issues as a longer term solution regards steve,0
var numbers for the 26 th hi vince i apologise that i did not send you the following mail kirsteee forwarded by kirstee hewitt lon ect on 28 07 2000 20 21 enron europe from kirstee hewitt 27 07 2000 20 33 to andreas barschkis mgusa com cc bjorn hagelmann hou ect ect grant masson hou ect ect subject var numbers for the 26 th hi andreas i have run the var model for the 26 th july and have attached a zip file of the results the total var is 4 170 653 and the cu position is 1 852 876 i have had trouble getting hold of you so i thought i would summarised what i wanted to talk about also i thought i would give your ears a rest basically it is wrt the second point in your mail yesterday we briefly discussed it earlier the fax you sent me to explain the risk calculation suggested that you use a 5 day period of adjustment to calculate the risk in this case it is called capital at risk the var calculation for our model is for a one day holding period which means that your risk factor will be reduced by a factor equal the sqrt 5 or 2 24 since old risk factor 1 65 std of the price movement 3 99 new daily risk factor 3 99 2 24 1 78 which actually equates to std of approx 1 1 a day i am happy with this as a estimate of the vol as the annualized spot vol we are showing for cu is approx 19 which equates to approx 1 2 daily using this new risk factor for the daily var the cu positions would give a var for the 19 th of approx 2 m which is less that the figure we estimated 3 100 568 the other thing is that by taking net numbers we are disregarding the term structure of the price curve vol curve and position curve and are hence collapsing everything into a one factor model which means that it is difficult to compare the numbers i hope that this helps to explain our number hopefully we can talk tomorrow cheers kirstee,0

precious metals var jason after our brief discussion last night i think i should discuss a few of the issues i have with respect to calculating a var on the deal that you are proposing the var model as i illustrated is set up to accept a term structure of delta positions prices and vols and it may be difficult to translate the silver mine position into these inputs i do not think that we can simply take the net silver content of the mine and then make some assumptions about vol and price the var model also assumes a certain amount of liquidity in the market and a 1 day holding period to do this properly i would need to understand fully how the deal is priced as these sensitivities are ultimately what will effect the change in mtm in the future and that is essentially what var is supposed to predict if you need me to work on this then you need to contact steve who will help to prioritise my time i will also need to consult with vince kaminski and tanya tamarachenko in houston for advice rac will also assist in the process please contact me if you have any further questions kirstee x 34529,0

nytimes com article the real wolf this article from nytimes com has been sent to you by vkaminski aol com advertisement looking for better it solutions toshiba is uniting digital mobile and network innovations in a bold new vision of information technology for today and tomorrow take a closer look at life in the new digital age and imagine how good it can be visit toshiba com for more details the real wolf reckonings by paul krugman ecently i received a letter from an economist i respect chiding me for my naderite columns on the california energy crisis he just didn t believe that market manipulation by power companies could possibly be an important issue it sounded too much to him like the sort of thing one hears from knee jerk leftists who blame greedy capitalists for every problem be it third world poverty or high apartment rents the left has cried wolf so many times that sensible people have learned to discount such claims but now a bona fide wolf has arrived whose predatory behavior is doing terrible damage to our most populous state and nobody will believe it true california would be heading for a summer of power shortages even if it had never deregulated and even if there was workable competition in the wholesale electricity market prices in that market would spike during periods of peak demand transferring billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the generators but the evidence is now overwhelming that there isn t workable competition in california s power market and that the actions of generators gaming the system have greatly magnified the crisis the key fact is that california has somehow remained in a state of more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale prices regardless of the level of demand a rash of outages has kept the electricity market conveniently and very profitably short of supply even during periods of low demand when there ought to be lots of excess capacity as frank wolak the stanford economist who also advises the state s power grid has pointed out an outage at a power plant is a lot like an employee calling in sick you can t tell directly whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for other reasons but you can look for circumstantial evidence and such evidence has convinced mr wolak that generators use forced outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market a view shared by a growing number of other researchers which brings us to the latest move by the federal energy regulatory commission on wednesday the commission apparently decided to offer california some relief and put new price caps in place on the california electricity market i say apparently because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to be any help at all indeed the measure was passed on a 2 to 1 vote with william massey the one commissioner who has been sympathetic to calls for price controls voting against it on the grounds that it would be ineffectual what s wrong with ferc s plan first it caps prices only in emergency conditions ignoring the fact that electricity prices have stayed at hard to explain levels even when there is no emergency in effect the plan is laid out as if the electricity market were really competitive in spite of all the evidence that it is not second even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes offering extensive opportunities for what mr wolak calls megawatt laundering selling power to affiliated companies that for one reason or another are exempted from the price controls for example the controls do not apply to imports from neighboring states then selling it back into the california market severin borenstein of the university of california energy institute adds that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at the least efficient plant generators will have a clear incentive to produce inefficiently i predict we will find some plants we never heard of before that are suddenly operating again and they will be pretty inefficient the general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan there are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there indeed last fall mr wolak submitted a proposal that was well received by other experts but ferc has ignored all of them the charitable interpretation is that ferc still doesn t get it that it just can t bring itself to believe that this time the wolf is real the uncharitable interpretation is that last week s action was meant to fail the medley report an online newsletter calls the ferc plan a grand exercise in posturing without substance a very clever temporary move by the bush administration to deflect any political fallout from the looming disaster whatever the explanation the plain fact is that ferc and the administration have yet to offer california any significant relief 00 fo 04 b 3 blabf visit nytimes com for complete access to the most authoritative news coverage on the web updated throughout

sabbatical dr kaminski i had intended to contact you regarding a position at enron this summer but the department really needed me to teach a section of undergraduate corporate finance this summer if all goes well and there is a place for me at enron i would be able to start after the summer session ends in late july i discussed the possibility of a sabbatical at enron with drs tom arnold and alex butler both of whom send their regards and they both felt the experience would be invaluable given my research and career objectives dr arnold and i agreed that a sabbatical of 1 2 years would be optimal i feel that it would be difficult to get a good idea of where the company is headed and to show how i can be a valuable team member in helping it get there in much less than a year he was afraid that the university would begin to grumble if i was gone for much more than 2 years any suggestions thank you again for your help and i look forward to hearing from you cordially shane green,0

re choosing the riskfree rate dear all i completeley agree with ben that treasuries are the most liquid and reliable benchmarks i also think that fmas have their own advantages and disadvantages however it looks like it would be very difficult for us to avoid using libor as benchmark at least to price anything related to capital markets for example credit default swaps our prices will always be different from that on capital markets if we use benchmarks different from the market as a half way solution we can have different benchmarks for example use anything that we decide is closest to risk free to value products significantly different from that priced on capital markets and libor for everything priced on capital markets we can adjust by manipulating other coefficients event liquidity recovery for our purposes but it looks like benchmark should be libor to avoid negative default probabilites for highly rated reference entities we can add cost fo repo and haircuts as all bankers do let us continue our discussion on this slava benjamin parsons 13 03 2000 20 07 to bryan seyfried lon ect ect martin mcdermott lon ect ect viacheslav danilov lon ect ect stuart ffoulkes lon ect ect eklavya sareen lon ect ect tomas valnek lon ect ect john metzler lon ect ect simon brooks lon ect ect konstantin malinovski lon ect ect cc vasant shanbhogue hou ect ect vince j kaminski hou ect ect steven leppard lon ect ect jitendra patel lon ect ect william s bradford hou ect ect harry arora hou ect ect subject choosing the riskfree rate dear all following on from the discussions had with vince et al a few weeks ago regarding the problems inherent in using treasuries as our benchmark riskfree curve i ve written the attached short document my preliminary conclusions are as follows recent turmoil in the treasury market mostly hit 10 and 30 year bonds treasuries are still the most liquid curve and that used by banks for benchmarking risky debt there is a considerable a liquidity scarcity premium inherent within the corporate treasury spread which we are not taking into account more accurate measurement of this premium should allow us to calculate bankruptcy prices based on treasuries which are consistent with the market all further comments are welcome of course regards ben,0

abstract shmuel this is the abstract for my presentation on the 23 rd of october i am in london and paris this week i can be reached at my private e mail address vkaminski aol com please feel free to suggest modifications to the abstract vince the last three years were characterized by exceptionally high volatility of the power prices in the us markets the market developments have created a number of unique challenges for energy industry economists one immediate question we have to answer is how to measure volatility of energy prices although we can all agree that the prices in the power markets are characterized by high variability the traditional measures used in financial economics annualized standard deviation of log price returns may not fit well electricity prices the second challenge is to explain the sources of high price volatility and to answer the question to what extent it can be attributed to problems that can be addressed in the long run such problems include flaws in market design that allow some market participants to abuse market power limited availability and or unequal access to transmission temporary shortages of generation capacity some factors underlying high volatility of electricity prices may be of permanent nature and may be a necessary price to pay for increased market efficiency and expanded customer choice,0

re generation earnings model michelle i agree with you that we need to run at least 500 iterations but i did not realize that it took 16 hours to run 100 iterations helen and i talked earlier about using parallel computing technique to split the algorithm into smaller parts and run the parts separately on different processors then aggregate the results this procedure makes better use of computer power and saves time looks like we have to do it this way now buying a more powerful computer helps but does not solve the problem in addition we might want to re consider if writing the code in vb is optimal i was assured at the very beginning that vb runs as fast if not faster as c but some re assurance from it group on this issue is helpful best alex from michelle d cisneros ect 04 09 2001 02 52 pm to alex huang corp enron enron cc gary hickerson danielle romain subject generation earnings model hi alex danielle and i were talking to david m today regarding running the model for purposes of back testing the results last week we ran calpine using 46 days of historical forward price data at 10 and 100 iterations the 100 iteration run took 16 hours to run to run all 20 companies with the 46 days worth of data and at 100 iterations is estimated to take about 28 days we are concerned that 100 iterations will not be sufficient and will need to be increased to at least 500 iterations we are thinking that we need to use a server or something much more powerful than the test computer we have been using do you have any suggestions as to how we can improve the process thanks michelle x 35435 hi alex danielle and i were talking to david m today regarding running the model for purposes of back testing the results last week we ran calpine using 46 days of historical forward price data at 10 and 100 iterations the 100 iteration run took 16 hours to run to run all 20 companies with the 46 days worth of data and at 100 iterations is estimated to take about 28 days we are concerned that 100 iterations will not be sufficient and will need to be increased to at least 500 iterations we are thinking that we need to use a server or something much more powerful than the test computer we have been using do you have any suggestions as to how we can improve the process thanks michelle x 35435,0

months although ggts is a new company it has some surprisingly experienced players at the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the keno com website which if youre marketing keno is as good as it gets keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream gambling game ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online gambling games including poker and sports book betting once it offers these popular games and given that it already has keno com online the company could bring in great revenues attracting a lot of attention in the investment community and driving up its stock price after a successful north american launch gaming transactions inc gtts has translated its games into chinese and is about to hit asia this initiative looks like a wise business decision many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest source of online gambling revenue by 2007 so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach what does all this tell us a brand new company a popular well known game one of the biggest spreads for the house a growing market experienced management and a stock price that is trading under a dollar it adds up to the potential for huge gains for early

re ebs var transaction policy i have two things biting me first is time i need to turn a draft for hannon and rice asap so the value of a deliberative approach to coming up with a v r policy will quickly evaporate if we take 2 weeks to study what the policy should say second i have a unique situation our concept of v r is really unlike the rest of enron s today what happens today is that network engineers unilaterally make decisions about deployment configuration and other matters which effect the longs and shorts of our asset contract portfolio that they view strictly from a network operating standpoint a good example was a decision to move our primary terapop three large servers storing 165 gigabytes each from portland to la the servers are already in place and purchased so no capital was involved but the decision has huge ramifications on the future la new york and other bandwidth usage and that cost money now it could be that the la new york cost is cheaper than the portland new york cost the whole point is no one knows what our value at risk policy attempt to corral is these types of decisions and put them into the hands of the risk management group where the decision will be made with at least some economic work behind it i really see the ebs v r policy to be misnamed since we don t really have the math done to calc v r it really is a volumetric based control policy that says you can t make network changes over xx amount of megabytes a storage measure or oc 3 equivalents a bandwidth measure without risk management making or approving the decision i do believe that with research s help we can in time actually calculate the v r impact of such decisions at that time the policy should be modified to set metrics based on the v r calculations so if you have an open enough mind to let us co op your word for a minute we need to start turning the minds of the network industry people into thinking about their decisions as having value effects said directly kevin hannon has given me authority to write a policy to move control over significant network changes from the field to the trading floor and i am going to issue something now to effectuate that so i really want your views on what we are doing but thought you needed some flavor and an sense of the urgency if you can weigh in do so quickly barry pearce 06 30 00 04 47 am to john echols

like this can not be implemented in some way we have attempted to do so through the enron corp transaction approval process tap i have forwarded to john a copy of this along with the risk management policy i ll let him share with you if ok i really don t want to act as the firm s in house kinko s we have taken the first step and done poorly on follow up steps to create a very easy to follow process for anything other than direct funded capital however some process around a greater number of assets deals is better than none i agree that i have not seen a really good fully baked one implemented but i think it is wrong not to try the only concerns i have is that given that we want to have standard metrics and approval processes around the firm ebs creates a process metric which is complementary to and integrates with processes metrics that the other business units are subjected to ted barry pearce enron communications 06 29 2000 09 09 am to stinson gibner hou ect ect dale

implemented a similiar policy across any of our other books that is we looking to bring in all the accrual operational assets as well as the mtm stuff lambdas to have a real live configuration of the system if assets routes servers etc are added what is the impact on the value of the system and what it s worth john has attached a draft below for your review and thoughts i can see how this works in a trading environment when you actually know the var of your whole trading portfolio however i ve not seen this done with a mixture of mtm accrual assets add the spice of a operational system valuation and this will be tough to quantify and model step 1 configure system and value it step 2 calculate a var on this we will need to do some work here step 3 calculate the incremental var of new

lou casari enron communications enron communications cc subject policies here is a first rough draft of a value risk transaction policy i would like you to start looking at where we are going on the policy and get some early thinking going on limits for the v r for example should we effectively shut down all server relocations without approval or allow some level of mb of storage to be moved around or reconfigured i need some commercial and industry realism for this we may need rick paiste or your industry helpers marquardt etc to help us barry lou i need your input,0

the storage revolution has begun network world fusion focus amy larsen decarlo on storage in the enterprise today s focus the storage revolution has begun 03 07 00 dear wincenty kaminski today s focus the storage revolution has begun by amy larsen decarlo believe the hype we are in the middle of a storage revolution virtually overnight businesses have gone from storing gigabytes to terabytes of data and the number of users accessing that information is skyrocketing the subsequent requirements are forcing companies to rethink their storage strategies and to recognize the importance of storage management in the equation of efficient information delivery it isn t just the volume of data or the higher scalability demands that are changing how businesses handle storage the premium that companies place on much of their enterprise information is having a profound effect on their storage requirements businesses demand fault tolerant storage systems that deliver swift and reliable data access to their employees suppliers and customers but given the fact that hard disk capacity requirements on average double every 12 months while processor speeds double every 18 months companies are left with a quandary how can they manage the proliferation of stored information efficiently enough to compensate for the differential between capacity requirements and processor speeds the simple answer to this question is to institute a well executed storage management plan that anticipates capacity requirements in advance and leverages the best technologies and techniques to support those needs bear in mind that the majority of storage costs come not from the equipment but from the implementation and support of those systems there are several ways to efficiently manage storage one of the best routes is consolidation that is pooling resources and managing storage as a system as opposed to a decentralized collection of file servers this may sound like a throwback to an earlier era when enterprise storage resided on mainframes but it s actually a progressive step as the consolidation has more to do with centralizing the planning management and ongoing support of storage systems than it does with the physical location of the files next it is important to recognize that not all information is equally important to the organization consequently storage requirements vary by business application as in all areas of it it is important to make storage implementation decisions based on business needs businesses trying to more efficiently manage storage are looking for alternatives to the distributed file server storage model they want to speed access to stored files and remove bandwidth intensive backup and recovery operations from the lan network attached storage nas supplies it professionals with one answer giving workstations and servers a way to gain direct access to stored data nas devices which have been widely available for years are optimized to process i o transactions though they promise better performance they don t remove backups from the transport network instead they supply a relatively easy to deploy solution to cross platform storage problems for most heterogeneous environments many consider storage area networks san to be the best long term answer to current and future storage challenges because sans are designed with a topology separate from the corporate data network they alleviate many of the availability and performance issues associated with more traditional storage models yet given the early deployment stage most companies are still in many of those capabilities are still largely untested in a production environment this newsletter will examine how through effective storage management it professionals can reduce support costs and improve service delivery to their customers this newsletter will not focus on items like the least expensive tape drive or the fast tape library instead it will look at how businesses can reduce inefficiencies and leverage emerging technologies to resolve their particular storage application issues ultimately the goal is to identify storage technology options and practices that work in

re stanford project forwarded by stinson gibner hou ect on 01 03 2001 08 54 am stinson gibner 12 27 2000 05 04 pm to nick bambos enron cc subject re stanford project nick hope you had a nice christmas best wishes for the new year it would certainly be great to see you and to meet eric some time in the next few months everyone here was very impressed with giuseppe and we are eager to have another of your students come to enron enron broadband is continuing to evolve and the current vision is to rely on enron s trading expertise while trying to minimize our role as an engineering company and innovator of technology i spoke recently with jim fallon the current head trader in ebs and we put together a short list of topics of interest where you might be able to help educate us i put these in the order of interest to mr fallon 1 where will bandwidth prices go the direction of prices obviously is the concern of any trader we realize that technological innovation will continue to drive down prices but are still interested in trying to quantify how fast prices will fall if there are likely to be certain bottlenecks in the fiber network where you could see prices stable or rising for some length of time if there are applications on the horizon which would use such prodigious amounts of bandwidth as to have some effect on pricing and if there is a rational way of trying to quantify the timing and effect on prices of new technologies the term bandwidth might primarily mean lit fiberoptic capacity but could also incompass dark fiber or ip transit and transport pricing 2 during the last year enron purchased a company known as warpspeed in order to acquire their metarouter technology to quote from the enron press release metarouter sends signals throughout distributed networks to determine the optimal connectivity paths for any size bandwidth capacity from anywhere in the world capable of processing thousands of connections per second metarouter significantly enhances enron s ability to automate circuit provisioning there may be two separate questions to ask here first in the context of the current market or the market which may develop in the next 1 2 years will the metarouter be a commercially viable product that is will it address an actual need in the market or would it be more cost effective just to use technicians with jumper cables to provision circuits the second question our first real technical question is the metarouter technology scalable before starting on this project vince and i will need to make the proper introductions with the principles who are implementing this technology 3 aggregation of loads a recurring question comes from a number of areas such as ip network storage and streaming media transport sales what value can i get form aggregating customers each of which has some type of stochastic load profile giuseppe touched on this problem as it relates to ip transport but it may be interesting to try and look in more detail the main stumbling block may be that we currently have basically no actual customer data i am told that in a few months we will have some more useful history my understanding is that what will be available will be 5 minute averages of usage so we still will not know on a short time scale what the distribution of load looks like i hope that this gives you enough information to get some idea of what our concerns are at this point please let me know your thoughts about these topics i would expect for instance that question number 1 may not be reasonable as a research project but might be a question which you would feel comfortable in addressing by giving us your qualitative opinions maybe in the form of a talk here at enron again let me know your thoughts and i look forward to seeing you again soon stinson nick bambos on 12 20 2000 12 14 40 pm to vince j kaminski enron com cc stinson gibner enron com subject stanford project hello vince and stinson first of all best wishes for happy holidays if you are in the stanford area during the holidays let s get together some time to have dinner i have formally established the project thanks again for funding it and i have also recruited the second phd student his name is eric cope and he is a top notch student very mature and entrepreneurial we have started working on some interesting problems in this area i would hope that eric could spend the coming summer at enron to get immersed into the problem opportunity generation environment that really helps the student to develop a realistic vision about their research perhaps our whole team could visit enron again some time in the next quarter say in march or so to discuss the research issues we are pursuing and of course you could visit us before that too with my warmest wishes nick,0

re equity investment fair value in turkey john it seems to me that using a risk free rate is not appropriate i shall elaborate on my position and send you a longer message this afternoon my time vince enron capital trade resources corp europe from john bottomley 06 19 2000 05 55 am to vince j kaminski hou ect ect cc john sherriff lon ect ect dale surbey lon ect ect subject equity investment fair value in turkey vince john sherriff recommended that i contact you regarding an interesting and potentially contentious option valuation issue we are currently dealing with in london we hold longish term options in a private company in turkey which is currently seeking to ipo the issue we are discussing with rac is which discount rate i e risk free and if so turkish or us should we use to value these options first some additional information option characteristics 116 000 options representing 9 of the company term minimum of 3 years but possibly longer still being renegotiated strike price 20 below the upcoming ipo price either priced in us or turkish lire we currently hold the above number of options with a fixed price of 118 75 per option but 34 800 expire on july 15 2000 with the remainder expiring on december 15 2000 the company s investment bankers abn amro rothchilds are concerned regarding the strike price because it values the company at 118 million and they believe the company is worth approx 300 million due to such a large valuation gap they originally encouraged us to exercise all of the options by the end of june ipo target date in late sept early oct our counter proposal is to swap instrinsic value for time value by repricing the options strike higher while extending their term we are currently negotiating with rac the most appropriate discount rate to use to value the options we are arguing that the us risk free is the most appropriate discount rate and their current position is that the company s historical senior debt cost 18 is the more appropriate number to use although admit that this is not justifiable only a proxy a few key points rac is valuing the options via crystal ball simulations such that this to be negotiated discount rate is used to calculate the pv of the future options intrinsic value in 3 years i e for black scholes a higher discount rate yields a higher value but the opposite is true using crystal ball simulation the model simulates both an ipo no ipo case and in the case of no ipo we have put options for our equity priced at a fixed 17 return the model assigns a 30 illiquidity discount in the simulated cases where the options are out of the money we obviously do not exercise we understand that for black scholes option valuation one needs to be able to construct a comparable portfolio of cash flows using equity futures and the risk free in order for the valuation to hold and here is where we reach our difficulty since the company doesn t currently trade on a public market and since equity futures do not exist for turkish equities rac is arguing that a us risk free is not appropriate to use our argument is that the non ipo scenario a 30 illiquidity discount and a us based option volatility are already in the factored into the simulation as such we feel rac s approach is double counting if you managed to get through the above your a patient man i ll give you a call today or tomorrow after you ve had a chance to digest the information regards john bottomley,0

b 2 b at enron tom i am sending you the information about our new b 2 b unit i have talked yesterday with greg whalley who is heading the new unit about the e commerce project at wharton and recommended that enron join this program i have sent him this morning a copy of the materials you gave me the meeting with jeff skilling has been pushed till the 2 nd half of july i talked to him briefly twice that jeff shankman and i want to discuss with him building a relationship with wharton jeff shankman is by the way a great friend of your institution vince companies finance the americas enron sees bricks and bytes mix reshaping energy market purchase of mg only a start in building b 2 b platforms writes hillary durgin companies financial times 16 jun 2000 12 00 00 am 604 words by hillary durgin if jeffrey skilling is right enron s acquisition of mg is only the tip of the iceberg enron s president and chief operating officer is engineering a fundamental strategy shift at the houston energy company aimed at making it a dominant new economy player across various industrial markets the dollars 446 m acquisition last month of mg the uk based metals trader is only the first of more than dollars lbn in estimated new investments the company is targeting it is seeking vehicles on which to build business to business b 2 b platforms in sectors such as logistics chemicals agricultural products and pulp paper mr skilling wants to take the business model the company developed in natural gas and power and apply it to other wholesale commodity markets he argues the electronic platforms it creates will not only become the principal b 2 b sites for those sectors but reshape those industries as an example he points to enron s new e commerce platform enrononline which has changed the way the company does business with its customers while significantly increasing sales the company the largest wholesale merchant of natural gas and power saw wholesale physical deliveries of natural gas surge 53 per cent in the first quarter critics argue that enron s move away from its familiar energy business into new industries where the learning curve is steep and the competition entrenched is risky yet a number of industry analysts point out enron has proved it understands markets and how to manage risks while becoming the largest importer of coal in the uk the largest trader of gas and power in the us and grabbing an advantage in bandwidth it s a prudent strategy but it s got to be done in an orderly way says ronald barone analyst with paine webber in new york what they re doing here is what they ve been incredibly successful at doing he adds noting that enron posted dollars 1 3 bn in earnings before interest and taxes ebit from its wholesale energy and services business in 1999 up 34 per cent from the previous year earnings from that division accounted for two thirds of the company s overall income before interest and taxes last year and mr barone sees the unit s ebit increasing 15 30 per cent annually over several years as with gas and power and now broadband where enron is standardising contracts and creating a market in bandwidth it wants to create markets by entering as a physical player and providing merchant risk management and financial services over the internet we will provide electronic commerce but we will provide liquidity and we will provide settlement or fulfilment of that contract mr skilling says that is an extremely powerful model if you look at other b 2 b sites they don t do that mr skilling argues enron s e commerce platform will triumph over the other bulletin board type exchanges where striking a deal depends on two parties hooking up and working through uncertainties over timing price credit and fulfilment not everyone shares that view some energy companies for example would rather not do business with a competitor bp amoco recently purchased a 3 per cent stake in altra energy technologies a houston based neutral wholesale energy exchange with koch industries and american electric power it also committed to carry out a fixed volume of transactions on the site to lend it liquidity just as in gas and power and now broadband and metals enron believes it needs networks of strategic physical assets in acquiring mg enron got a stable of warehouses lending it a strong physical position it should provide mg with a more vibrant more active physical spot market in more markets in the world says greg whalley chief executive officer of enron net works the new division enron is launching to identify and enter commodity markets he argues that in metals and other markets enron will deliver better pricing price risk management services cross commodity transactions and flexible transactions for a wider range of customers mr skilling says there are significant rewards for restructuring an industry if you can take that platform and you use the capabilities the bricks bring to the table e commerce the industry and change the structure you re selling for more than a 50 multiple copyright the financial times limited,0

a colossal and dangerous failure cera alert title a colossal and dangerous failure url http www 20 cera com eprofile u 35 m 2185 overview western energy california governor stays the course california governor gray davis provided his strongest public statements to date regarding the state s power crisis in his annual state of the state address on january 8 2001 echoing many of his previous positions on what he perceives as a flawed and unfair california market structure the governor labeled the state s electricity market system a colossal and dangerous failure among other actions he launched new initiatives valued at 1 billion to encourage conservation provide financing and land to new generators grant authority to utilities to engage in a portfolio of transactions to manage electricity costs and increase regulatory scrutiny of existing market suppliers the governor also called for a greater role for the state in overseeing and constructing new power plants the governor acknowledged that the actions proposed are only some of the steps necessary to put california on the road to recovery details regarding sources of funding for the initiative are still forthcoming although he stated that california s investor owned utilities must not be allowed to go bankrupt no formal plan for ensuring their solvency was given the financial community continues to lack the assurance it requires to continue to provide financial backing for pacific gas and electric and southern california edison at this time the state legislature remains the body most likely to guarantee their solvency the governor again criticized the federal energy regulatory commission for what he believes has been its failure to manage and restrain properly the wholesale market merchant plant generators were accused of gouging the state and it was suggested that these generators acted illegally in their operations jeopardizing the reliability of the power grid new more severe sanctions were promised for those caught withholding power or extracting what investigators find as unreasonable profits a los angeles times poll released the morning before the governor s address indicated that the majority of californians still do not believe there is an energy crisis although the 33 percent growth in the state s economy over the past ten years has nearly outstripped the state s and surrounding region s supplies of power the bulk of the governor s statements continue to focus on the culpability of power producers rather than the serious supply shortfall though the governor introduced steps to fund and facilitate the construction of new generating plants increased regulatory scrutiny and the threat of sanctions will exacerbate the concern already expressed by plant developers and the financial community that the investment climate in california is excessively risky end follow above url for complete report come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 shooting the rapids strategies and risks for the energy future in houston february 12 16 2001 for more information and to register please visit http www 20 cera com ceraweek e mail category alert cera knowledge area s western energy to make changes to your cera com account go to forgot your username and password go to http www 20 cera com client forgot this electronic message and attachments if any contain information from cambridge energy research associates inc cera which is confidential and may be privileged unauthorized disclosure copying distribution or use of the contents of this message or any attachments in whole or in part is strictly prohibited terms of use http www 20 cera com tos questions comments webmaster cera com copyright 2000 cambridge energy research associates,0

folks attached is a conservative and fairly rough estimate of the size of the petrochemicals and refining market that is potentially exposed to prolonged drought in southern texas which could result in extremely low riverflows and possible curtailed production the total annual revenue generated by these assets is no less than 20 b and could be substantially higher as the estimated capacity on some of these facilties is likely understated and other facilties not yet identified are likely to be vulnerable note that this data does not include any facilities in the industrial complexes from houston northward and eastward as they are much less likely to experience such a drought induced interruption the only facilties identified thus far lie on or near the following rivers brazos colorado navidad guadalupe and nueces please let me know if you have any questions comments as we work to determine whether or not a low riverflow insurance product is viable thanks charlie,0

presentation at ut vince i appreciate your response to my request for you to speak to my class on real options i thought you might enjoy the following exchange of emails that occurred yesterday perhaps some of these issues could be addressed in your talk jim original message from sheridan titman sent friday march 31 2000 9 11 am to jim dyer subject re real options course feedback jim your student has raised some difficult questions i would recommend ehud but i thought that the finance people have the answers in cases with complete markets and that we rely on the decision science people for cases with incomplete markets if it would help i can come in at 6 pm after my class in a couple of weeks sheridan sheridan titman department of finance college of business administration

titman subject fw real options course feedback sheridan see the comments below i don t mean to put you on the spot and have not announced anything in class but i am hoping that you could visit my class for about an hour one thursday afternoon to discuss your views regarding applications of option pricing concepts to real options as a reminder i ve attached a course outline chris kenyon from schlumberger is speaking on april 13 and vince kaminski has tentatively agreed to speak on april 20 i am going to be out of town on april 27 so that leaves either next thursday april 6 or may 4 would either of those times work for you i m not thinking of any preparation but more of an informal discussion of the philosophical issues related to real options work jim original message from jim dyer sent thursday march 30 2000 1 24 pm to jclevenger optionii bus utexas edu subject re real options course feedback josh some very thoughtful observations as you know i had invited one finance professor to our class on arundel but he was out of town i do plan to invite sheridan titman to discuss the issue of using the option models in situations where there is no underlying security that is traded i do think it is important to face that issue which is actually covered at a theoretical level in our last couple of readings the issue of volatility is also an excellent issue for further discussion as you suggest so far we ve been looking at cases where volatility is given the problem of finding an objective measure of volatility for a project reminds me of the problem of finding the correct risk adjusted discount rate which is not surprising since the concepts are almost two sides of the same plate one approach of course is to do some modeling using traditional decision analysis tools including subjective probabilities but the finance people who write options articles don t like to think about such ideas i ll try to address these issues in more detail as the semester continues i think it was important to surface some of these points early and to come back to them after we have seen how to apply the methods in a naive sort of way thanks for the feedback and comments jim original message from jclevenger optionii bus utexas edu sent thursday march 30 2000 8 42 am to jim dyer bus utexas edu cc josh clevenger reliantenergy com subject real options course feedback after overcoming the initial i hope overload of materials and tools presented thus far in the semester it appears to me that you are achieving the objective of making us comfortable with optionality valuation as applied to a variety of problems which are outside the borders defined by a liquid market of traded financial elements as a constructive feedback you have been forthright with us in marking off areas of this subject which are still controversial i also realize that rightly so real world application of this type of analysis without a robust understanding of finance may degenerate into a succession of assumptions that result in a house of cards effect my opinion at this point is that two issues are of potentially make or brake importance if i am to persuade my superiors to accept these methods for valuations outside the realm of projects whose value is primarily driven by the value of commodities backed by financial instruments these issues are easy to guess 1 discounting and risk free rates i do not sense that anyone in the class has put forth convincing arguments as to the proper application of time value questions in the absence of liquidity is there someone within the finance department that can present a firmer position on this question 2 volatility i found winston s examples on this metric succinct i would recommend that in future years you dedicate some hours of class time to this subject my criticism again relates to messy problems i anticipate arguments against real option applications based on the dispute of volatility measures if i were a conservative financial manager i would argue that two a implied volatility derived from an industry specific slice of equity options is a shotgun approach the projects being valued are of a tranche which may in fact have a significantly different outcome variance than the weighted average measured by the equities utilized oil gas and electricty are good examples the major players are competing on many different levels of the value chain smaller companies do exist which are dedicated to one strata but what about projects that want to exploit opportunies across strata in a vertically integrated company two b based on the following skepticism if a real option value is being proposed for a new business venture some new unexploited opportunity there is some paradox embedded in the increased value based on high volatility in new ventures and the high risk of failure this skepticism is likely to be less acute in high tech sectors where the huge upside of new ventures is paraded before us daily by nasdq touts it is a much harder sell to mature industries of particular interest in the power industry are investments centered around opportunities arising from restructuring of electricity and natural gas sectors as regulation is removed a large proportion of the risk is embedded in ongoing changes of public policy on an international basis as an intentionally screwed up example can anyone other than a financial genius correctly asses volatility for u s companies investing in seed projects in mexico based on speculation of the inevitable

possible rtp conference dear mr kaminski thank you for talking with me about a possible rtp conference i would like to include some discussions of what has been learned in other industries as i indicated frank wolak suggested that i contact you in discussing power markets with frank and other colleagues at stanford and epri it seems quite evident that real time pricing for retail customers is the forgotten resource in more efficient power markets there seems to be a lot of confusion about what rtp means and it also seems that many researchers need to address some practical but important problems i was asked whether a group like stanford s emf might explore this topic and give it the visibility that would have it considered more seriously by policymakers frank thought that you might be someone who could help me structure a useful approach and who might also see whether enron could become a major sponsor i was hoping that this issue was sufficiently important to enron that the company might consider providing 25 000 as you may appreciate it requires some thought and effort to make sure that the product of the conference is widely circulated among key government groups i would be very interested in hearing from you if you can provide ideas and recommendations for people perhaps yourself or a colleague to participate i would also appreciate any consideration by enron of providing funding for this effort thank you hill huntington retail notes rtf hillard g huntington emf an international forum on energy and environmental markets voice 650 723 1050 408 terman center fax 650 725 5362 stanford university email hillh stanford edu stanford ca 94305 4026 emf website http www stanford edu group emf,0

re fw pserc nuggets related to market stem hi vince and happy new year good to hear from you and i can understand being busy i am myself trying to balance my commitments here like any research consortium pserc is trying to provide value to its members while walking the fine line between cooperation and competition we are definitely not in the business of providing proprietary research to the members but rather working on more generic areas that later individual members could see way to convert to proprietary tools the work that shijie deng and rajnish kamat have been doing with me are good examples as to my trip thanks for the invitation but i already committed myself to get back friday night so i will save my visit for another time i will tell my son about the spring interviews at cornell hopefully this time he will not miss it regards shmuel original message from to cc sent monday january 08 2001 1 40 pm subject re fw pserc nuggets related to market stem hello shmuel thanks for your message the end of 2000 and the beginning of 2001 were extremely busy and i could not focus on pserc issues i shall consult a few people in enron on this subject and get in touch with you our concern right now is that the results of research are widely shared with our competition i am out on the 19 th but the 20 th would work for me i would be glad to cover the cost of your austin to houston trip regarding your son the analyst associate program will interview again on the campus in the spring and they will be more than happy to interview him shmuel oren on 12 19 2000 01 40 02 pm to cc dennis ray subject fw pserc nuggets related to market stem hello vince happy holidays i wanted to connect with you regarding the possibility of enron joining pserc as you might have heard from lance and alex we are going through a transition period having doubled the number of universities and industry members within the last year consequently our business processes are not well developed one of the problems we are facing is the balance between the electrical engineering folks and industry members that are more interested in market related research i hope to recruit more of the later so tat we have more of a constituency in the advisory board that sees the value of market related research i already have a verbal commitment from people at electrabell that expressed interest in joining pserc with members like electrabell and enron we will be able to support more market stem projects such as the one that shijie deng proposed not funded in this round please let me know if i can do anything to facilitate the decision at enron i am going to be in austin on january 19 to participate at a puct hearing and could come through huston for a visit attached are some items that i shared with our pserc members and thought that you might be interested in them as well regards shmuel original message from shmuel oren to power systems engineering research center sent tuesday december 19 2000 9 47 am subject re pserc nuggets related to market stem the following are 3 items that demonstrate the impact of pserc research in the market stem area 1 on december 12 i shmuel oren

as part of my testimony i presented a movie produced by tim mount and bob thomas that show results of an experimental economic study showing how bidders respond by raising their bids in a pay as bid

all the panel members and other participants the panel greatly appreciates your involvement in this important project thanks again natalie efland 2 a recent e mail from the texas puc professor oren i hope you and your family are doing well we are seriously considering your help and advice to facilitate the commission s final decision regarding retail competition in ercot i wanted to let you know that ercot stakeholders filled an application for approval of the ercot protocols in november we received comments including list of issues on november 22 and reply comments on december 1 staff will draft and submit a preliminary order to the commissioners for their discussion on december 13 there will be a pre hearing on december 15 when parties will be asked to brief the commission on list of issues by the end of first week in january there will be a hearing on january 16 followed with another hearing if needed parties have asked the commission to finalize its decision by mid march to give you some more background i have to mention that almost most of your suggestions were accepted and will be reflected in the final protocols except for problems with intra zonal gaming regarding congestion management and pay as bid compensation for selected ancillary services a few additional concerns are raised regarding ancillary services and congestion management stakeholders are still working toward more load participation in ercot market however the main problem is the fact that market pilot that covers 100 of wholesale but only 5 of retail load will be open on june 1 2001 based on a version of the protocols locked on august 1 2000 that was the deadline for ercot to give a final design to anderson consulting that version does not include some of your recommendations to address market design flaws the full version is highly possible to be implemented by january 1 2002 when market for 100 retail competition is scheduled to open given this gap some parties have recommended not to implement incomplete protocols and wait for full implementation by january 2002 in other words they say let s go ahead with 5 pilot retail load but wait for full design implementation before allowing 100 wholesale load and retail load be subject to the rules of the game described in the final protocols thanks parviz adib ph d director of market oversight division public utility commission of texas 1701 n congress avenue p o box 13326 austin texas 78711 3326 ph no 512 936 7365 3 the following is a segment from a published summary of the dec 13 puct hearing this segment describes the commision s deliberation on an agenda item addressing the possibility of instituting price caps as part of the ercot protocols see reference to my involvement in the next to last paragraph docket no 23220 petition of the electric reliability council of texas for approval of the ercot protocols discussion and possible action parviz adib jess totten keith rogas and tammy cooper chairman wood turned to page 2 item number 3 of the draft order identifying issues recommending that the word including be changed to other than in the parentheses he thinks they know the ups and downs of the two mechanisms which are bid caps and price caps but would not mind having parties focus on what other protections might be used commissioner walsh would say including but not limited to because she does not think it is a bad idea for ercot to at least consider in their protocols a fail safe mechanism it s kind of like the stock market suspending trading when something crazy happens they could consider a maximum scenario such as we don t think this will ever happen but if it does we need to muffle it whether it is 1 000 or 99 or whatever it is they could consider whether to put into the protocols a self enacting price cap while not expecting it to happen if it did you don t have to declare it an emergency and have the commission have to act chairman wood asked if they could leave the question without the parenthetical at all and just say what protections should be added to avoid extreme price spikes commissioner walsh reiterated that she wants ercot to think about the unlikely possibility of unacceptable price spikes she would like for them to have their own fail safe mechanism that is self initiating as opposed to leaving that to having someone have to come in and act commissioner perlman stated that he thinks the california type price caps is what the concern is about he thinks everyone in this state is opposed to those but he thinks the point commissioner walsh is making is an interesting one he had not thought about the circuit breaker idea and it might have some merit he agreed that it was worth considering something like that then the question becomes what the level is chairman wood suggested the wording what self implementing protections should be added to avoid the price spikes commissioner perlman said he did not think anyone is talking about 250 price caps commissioner walsh agreed but noted that if the unexpected happens we should be prepared commissioner perlman indicated that if someone is making 10 000 in one particular hour that it probably does not b enefit the market and is probably a windfall to them it is not something they would normally put in their business plan for determining whether they are going to build a plant in texas chairman wood stated that they want to lean toward the market as heavily as they can on these issues chairman wood noted that some of these issues date back to when dr oren was assisting the commission and asked if he could be brought back again staffer dr parviz adib said that staff had already talked to dr oren and that he is available to assist the commission further chairman wood noted that dr oren had helped people think outside the box without just focusing on california the final wording was clarified to state self implementing mechanisms and to delete the parenthetical part of the sentence in question the order was approved as amended,0

calculating bid ask prices this is about enron movie trading business where we are a market maker for trading future of a movie s gross box office receipt rich sent to many people a writing explaining his movie trading idea and asked us to provide some feedback i think the idea see below might be applicable to other parts of enron we can call it dynamic bid ask price process in fact we can set that the bidding period is closed when no new bid is submitted to the system within a specified amount of time the final clearing bid and ask prices are just the last tentative price shown to the public before the bidding period ends so the customers can see the final price before the market close and can revise their bids if they wish i think this method is suitable for illiquid products to be traded via enrononline com chonawee forwarded by chonawee supatgiat corp enron on 04 24 2001 07 48 pm chonawee supatgiat 04 24 2001 07 40 pm to richard dimichele enron communications enron communications cc chonawee supatgiat corp enron enron cynthia harkness enron communications enron communications greg wolfe hou ect ect james ginty enron communications enron communications jim fallon enron communications enron communications kelly kimberly enron communications enron communications kevin howard enron communications enron communications key kasravi enron communications enron communications kristin albrecht enron communications enron communications kristina mordaunt enron communications enron communications martin lin contractor enron communications enron communications paul racicot enron communications enron communications zachary mccarroll enron communications enron communications martin lin contractor enron communications enron communications subject calculating bid ask prices i think we should let the price float with the market instead of trying to forecast it otherwise if our forecast is not consistence with the market we may have an imbalance in the bid ask orders and we may end up taking some positions you know as russ and martin pointed out we cannot fight with the studio and exhibitors because they have inside information and can game the price easily one way to ensure the balance of the bid ask orders is to embed an exchange system inside our bid ask prices front end each week we have a trading period during the period instead of posting bid ask prices we post tentative bid ask prices then we ask our customers to submit their acceptable buying or selling price these tentative bid ask prices get updated and are shown to the public of course customers can revise withdraw their bids anytime during the trading period at the end of the period we calculate and post the final bid and ask prices the seller who submits lower selling price than our final bid price gets paid at the bid price the buyer who submits higher buying price than our final ask price pays at the ask price next week we repeat the same process this way we can manage our positions easily and we can also behave like a broker where we don t take any position at all we make profit from those bid ask spread we don t have to worry about forecasting accuracy and insiders trading because we don t have to take any position let the market be the one who decides the price if we maintain our net position as zero at the end when all the actual gross box office numbers are reported in those publications our customers with open long short positions are perfectly matched using the mark to market charge can reduce credit risk thanks chonawee forwarded by chonawee supatgiat corp enron on 04 24 2001 07 24 pm chonawee supatgiat 04 20 2001 04 31 pm to richard dimichele enron communications enron communications key kasravi enron communications enron communications cc martin lin contractor enron communications enron communications subject some more input hi rich and key again i think your idea is very good i think that we as a market maker can reduce our credit risk risk of default if we do the mark to market charging that is each week when we release a new expected value of the gross box office receipt we balance all the opening positions the same way as in a regular future market this way we can give margin calls to the couterparties who are expected to owe us a lots of money in the last paragraph i think the gross box office can also be determined from the market itself i e if there are lots of buyers our offer price should go up we can offer other derivative products such as options as well chonawee,0
